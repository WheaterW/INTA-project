    "ExtraInfo": "Use this command to set the same source address for all FTP connections.In Cisco IOS 12.3(6) and later releases, FTP is VRF-aware, which means that FTP transfer is supported across an interface within a VRF instance. To specify a VRF as a source for FTP connections, the VRF must be associated with the same interface that you configure with the **ip ftp source-interface** command. In this configuration, FTP looks for the destination IP address for file transfer in the specified VRF table. If the specified source interface is not up, Cisco IOS software selects the address of the interface closest to the destination as the source address.",
