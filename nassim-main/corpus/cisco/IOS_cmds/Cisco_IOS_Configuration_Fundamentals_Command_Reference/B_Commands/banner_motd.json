    "ExtraInfo": "Follow this command with one or more blank spaces and a delimiting character of your choice. Then enter one or more lines of text, terminating the message with the second occurrence of the delimiting character.This MOTD banner is displayed to all terminals connected and is useful for sending messages that affect all users (such as impending system shutdowns). Use the **no****exec-banner** or **no****motd-banner** command to disable the MOTD banner on a line. The **no****exec-banner** command also disables the EXEC banner on the line.When a user connects to the router, the MOTD banner appears before the login prompt. After the user logs in to the router, the EXEC banner or incoming banner will be displayed, depending on the type of connection. For a reverse Telnet login, the incoming banner will be displayed. For all other connections, the router will display the EXEC banner.To customize the banner, use tokens in the form $(*token*) in the message text. Tokens will display current Cisco IOS configuration variables, such as the router's host name and IP address. The tokens are described in [Table 16](#wp1014588).Table 16 banner motd Tokens| Token | Information Displayed in the Banner || --- | --- || **$(hostname)** | Displays the host name for the router. || **$(domain)** | Displays the domain name for the router. || **$(line)** | Displays the vty or tty (asynchronous) line number. || **$(line-desc)** | Displays the description attached to the line. |  ",
