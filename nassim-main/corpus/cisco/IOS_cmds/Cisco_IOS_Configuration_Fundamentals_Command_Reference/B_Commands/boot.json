Enter only lowercase commands.These commands work only if there is a valid image to boot. Also, from the ROM monitor prompt, issuing a prior reset command is necessary for the boot to be consistently successful.In Cisco IOS Release 12.3(4)T, MONLIB was modified to search in media for a valid Cisco IOS image.
