    "ExtraInfo": "Use the **rsh** command to execute commands remotely. The host on which you remotely execute the command must support the rsh protocol, and theÂ *.rhosts* files on the rsh host must include an entry that permits you to remotely execute commands on that host.For security reasons, the software does not default to a remote login if no command is specified, as does UNIX. Instead, the router provides Telnet and connect services that you can use rather than rsh.",
