    "ExtraInfo": "This command can be useful for troubleshooting system bus errors. The system encounters a bus error when the processor tries to access a memory location that either does not exist (a software error) or does not respond properly (a hardware problem).To use the **show region** command to troubleshoot a bus error, note the memory location address from the **show version** command, the **show context** command, or from the system error message that alerted you to the bus error. The **show region** command can then be used to determine if that address is a valid memory location.For example, in the output of the **show version** command after a system restart caused by a bus error, you will see output similar to \"System restarted by bus error at PC 0x30EE546, address 0xBB4C4.\" In this case, the memory location that the router tried to access is 0xBB4C4. If the address falls within one of the ranges in the **show region** output, it means that the router was accessing a valid memory address, but the hardware corresponding to that address is not responding properly. This indicates a hardware problem.If the address reported by the bus error does not fall within the ranges displayed in the **show region** output, this error means that the router was trying to access an address that is not valid, which indicates that it is a Cisco IOS software problem.More detailed information is available on Cisco.com in Tech Note #7949, *[Troubleshooting Bus Error Crashes](http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/sw/iosswrel/ps1831/products_tech_note09186a00800cdd51.shtml)*.Transient Memory AllocationThe Transient Memory Allocation feature is enabled on platforms like the Cisco 7200 series router and the Cisco 10000 series router. This feature allocates all transient memory in a separate memory address space (separate region), so that there is no interleaving of static and transient memory blocks. Hence, the output of the **show region** command will have heap region memory size in chunks of 16 MB.",
