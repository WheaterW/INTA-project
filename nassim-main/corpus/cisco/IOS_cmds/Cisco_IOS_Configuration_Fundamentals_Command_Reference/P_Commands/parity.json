    "ExtraInfo": "Communication protocols provided by devices such as terminals and modems sometimes require a specific parity bit setting. Refer to the documentation for your device to determine required parity settings.If you use this command to set parity on Cisco AS5350 and Cisco AS5400 NextPort lines, do not also set parity by means of S-register settings in a modemcap. (A modemcap is a series of parameter settings that are sent to your modem to configure it to interact with a Cisco device in a specified way. Cisco IOS software defines modemcaps that have been found to properly initialize most modems so that they function properly with Cisco routers and access servers.)",
