    "ExtraInfo": "For Cisco IOS Release 12.2(11)T, IP and Internetwork Packet Exchange (IPX) extended access lists are the only functions that can use time ranges. For further information on using these functions, refer to the *Cisco IOS IP Configuration Guide* and the *Cisco IOS AppleTalk and Novell IPX Configuration Guide*.The **periodic** command is one way to specify when a time range is in effect. Another way is to specify an absolute time period with the **absolute** command. Use either of these commands after the **time-range** global configuration command, which specifies the name of the time range. Multiple **periodic** entries are allowed per **time-range** command.If the end days-of-the-week value is the same as the start value, they can be omitted.If a **time-range** command has both **absolute** and **periodic** values specified, then the **periodic** items are evaluated only after the **absolute start** time is reached, and are not further evaluated after the **absolute end** time is reached.![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/note.gif)---**Note** ![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)All time specifications are taken as local time. To ensure that the time range entries take effect at the desired times, you should synchronize the system software clock using Network Time Protocol (NTP).---[Table 39](#wp1014489) lists some typical settings for your convenience:Table 39 Typical Examples of periodic Command Syntax| If you want: | Configure this: || --- | --- || Monday through Friday, 8:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. only | **periodic weekday 8:00 to 18:00** || Every day of the week, from 8:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. only | **periodic daily 8:00 to 18:00** || Every minute from Monday 8:00 a.m. to Friday 8:00 p.m. | **periodic monday 8:00 to friday 20:00** || All weekend, from Saturday morning through Sunday night | **periodic weekend 00:00 to 23:59** || Saturdays and Sundays, from noon to midnight | **periodic weekend 12:00 to 23:59** |  ",
