    "ExtraInfo": "The Parser Cache feature optimizes the parsing (translation and execution) of Cisco IOS software configuration command lines by remembering how to parse recently encountered command lines, decreasing the time required to process large configuration files.The parser cache is enabled by default. However, if you wish to disable the parser cache, you may do so using the **no parser cache** command in global configuration mode. To reenable the parser cache after it has been disabled, use the **parserÂ cache** command.When the **no parser cache** is issued, the command line appears in the running configuration file. However, if the parser cache is reenabled, no command line appears in the running configuration file.",
