    "ExtraInfo": "The memory test overwrites memory. If you use the **test memory** command, you will need to rewrite nonvolatile memory. For example, if you test Multibus memory, which is the memory used by the CSC-R 4-Mbps Token Ring interfaces, you will need to reload the system before the network interfaces will operate properly. The **test memory** command is intended primarily for use by Cisco personnel.",
