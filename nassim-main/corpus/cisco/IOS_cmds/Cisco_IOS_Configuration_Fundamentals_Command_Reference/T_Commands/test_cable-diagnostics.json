    "ExtraInfo": "Cable diagnostics can help you detect whether your cable has connectivity problems.The TDR test guidelines are as follows:•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)TDR can test cables up to a maximum length of 115 meters.•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)The TDR test is supported on Cisco 7600 series routers running Release 12.2(17a)SX and later releases on specific mdoules. See the Release Notes for Cisco IOS Release 12.2SX on the Catalyst 6500 and Cisco 7600 Supervisor Engine 720, Supervisor Engine 32, and Supervisor Engine 2 for the list of the modules that support TDR.•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)The valid values for **interface** *type* are **fastethernet** and **gigabitethernet**.•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)Do not start the test at the same time on both ends of the cable. Starting the test at both ends of the cable at the same time can lead to false test results.•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)Do not change the port configuration during any cable diagnostics test. This action may result in incorrect test results.•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)The interface must be up before running the TDR test. If the port is down, the **test cable-diagnostics tdr** command is rejected and the following message is displayed:```Router# test cable-diagnostics tdr interface gigabitethernet2/12``````% Interface Gi2/12 is administratively down``````% Use 'no shutdown' to enable interface before TDR test start.``````  ```•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)If the port speed is 1000 and the link is up, do not disable the auto-MDIX feature.•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)For fixed 10/100 ports, before running the TDR test, disable auto-MDIX on both sides of the cable. Failure to do so can lead to misleading results.•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)For all other conditions, you must disable the auto-MDIX feature on both ends of the cable (use the **no mdix auto** command). Failure to disable auto-MDIX will interfere with the TDR test and generate false results.•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)If a link partner has auto-MDIX enabled, this action will interfere with the TDR-cable diagnostics test and test results will be misleading. The workaround is to disable auto-MDIX on the link partner.•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)If you change the port speed from 1000 to 10/100, enter the **no mdix auto** command before running the TDR test. Note that entering the **speed** **1000** command enables auto-MDIX regardless of whether the **no mdix auto** command has been run.",
