Entering the escape character followed by the X key returns you to EXEC mode when you are connected to another computer.![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/note.gif)---**Note** ![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)The Break key generally cannot be used as an escape character on the console terminal because the operating software interprets the Break command on a console line as an instruction to halt the system.---",
