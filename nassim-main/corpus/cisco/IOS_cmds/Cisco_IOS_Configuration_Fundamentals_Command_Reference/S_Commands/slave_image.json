On the CiscoÂ 7507 and Cisco 7513 router, you can install two RSP cards in a single router to improve system availability. Dual RSP Cards is a High System Availability (HSA) feature.Use the **slave image** command to override the slave image that is bundled with the master image.When using HSA for simple hardware backup, ensure that the slave image is in the same location on the master and the slave RSP card. Thus, if the slave RSP card becomes the master, it will be able to find the slave image and download it to the new slave.![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/note.gif)---**Note** ![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)The default length of the bootstring filename is 64 characters.
