    "ExtraInfo": "When running the advanced IP services feature set on either Cisco 880 Series routers or Cisco 890 Series routers, use the **service-module wlan-ap 0 bootimage unified** commandto enable the Cisco unified software upgrade image on the embedded wireless access point. After enabling the unified image, use the **service-module wlan-ap 0 reload** command to perform a graceful shutdown and reboot of the access point.![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/note.gif)---**Note** ![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)The **service-module wlan-ap 0 bootimage** command does not support recovery images on the embedded access point. Use the **service-module wlan-ap 0 reload** command to shutdown and reboot the access point.---Cisco 880 Series and Cisco 890 Series routers with embedded access point running the unified software image require DHCP to obtain an IP address for the access point. An IP address is needed to communicate with the Wireless LAN Controller (WLC) and to download its image upon boot up. The host router can provide DHCP server functionality through the DHCP pool to reach the WLC, and setup option 43 for the controller IP address in the DHCP pool configuration.Use the following guideline to setup a DHCP pool on the host router.```ip dhcp pool embedded-ap-pool``````    network 60.0.0.0 255.255.255.0``````    default router 60.0.0.1``````    option 43 hex f104.0a0a.0a0f  /* Single WLC IP address (10.10.10.15) in HEX format */``````int vlan 1  /* Default Vlan */``````ip address 60.0.0.1 255.255.255.0``````int Wlan-GigabitEthernet0 /* internal switch-port to AP */``````switchport access vlan 1```",
