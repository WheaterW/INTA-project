    "ExtraInfo": "When you attempt to connect to a device, the router displays addresses and other messages (for example, \"Trying router1 (171.69.1.154, 2008)...).\" With the hide feature, the router suppresses the display of the address (for example, \"Trying router1 address #1...\"). The router continues to display all other messages that would normally be displayed during a connection attempt, such as detailed error messages if the connection was not successful.The hide feature improves the functionality of the busy-message feature. When you configure only the **busy-message** command, the normal messages generated during a connection attempt are not displayed; only the busy-message is displayed. When you use the hide and busy features together you can customize the information displayed during Telnet connection attempts. When you configure the **serviceÂ hide-telnet-address** command and the **busy-message** command, the router suppresses the address and displays the message specified with the **busy-message** command if the connection attempt is not successful.",
