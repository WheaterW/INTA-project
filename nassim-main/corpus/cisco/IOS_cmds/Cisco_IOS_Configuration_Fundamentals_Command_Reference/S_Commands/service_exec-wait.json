    "ExtraInfo": "This command delays startup of the EXEC until the line has been idle (no traffic seen) for 3 seconds. The default is to enable the line immediately on modem activation.This command is useful on noisy modem lines or when a modem attached to the line is configured to ignore MNP/V.42 negotiations, and MNP/V.42 modems may be dialing in. In these cases, noise or MNP/V.42 packets may be interpreted as usernames and passwords, causing authentication failure before the user has a chance to type a username or password. The command is not useful on nonmodem lines or lines without some kind of login configured.",
