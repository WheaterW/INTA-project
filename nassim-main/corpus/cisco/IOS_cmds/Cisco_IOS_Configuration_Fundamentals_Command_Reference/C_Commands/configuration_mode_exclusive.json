    "ExtraInfo": "The **configuration mode exclusive** command enables the exclusive configuration lock feature. The exclusive configuration lock allows single-user access to configuration modes using single-user configuration mode. While the device configuration is locked, no other users can enter configuration commands.Users accessing the device using the state-full, session-based transports (telnet, Secure Shell (SSH) are able to enter single-user configuration mode. The user enters single-user configuration mode by acquiring the exclusive configuration lock using the **configure terminal lock** privileged EXEC mode command. The configuration lock is released when the user exits configuration mode by using the **end** or **exit** command, or by pressing Ctrl-Z. While a user is in single-user configuration mode, no other users can configure the device. Users accessing Command Line Interface (CLI) options through stateless protocols (that is, the HTTP web-based user interface) cannot access single-user configuration mode. (However, an Application Programming Interface (API) allows the stateless transports to lock the configuration mode, complete its operations, and release the lock.)",
