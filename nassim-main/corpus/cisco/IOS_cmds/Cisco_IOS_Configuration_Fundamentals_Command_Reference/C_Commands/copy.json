    "ExtraInfo": "The fundamental function of the **copy** command is to allow you to copy a file (such as a system image or configuration file) from one location to another location. The source and destination for the file is specified using a Cisco IOS File System URL, which allows you to specify any supported local or remote file location. The file system being used (such as a local memory source, or a remote server) dictates the syntax used in the command.You can enter on the command line all necessary source- and destination-URL information and the username and password to use, or you can enter the **copy** command and have the router prompt you for any missing information.For local file systems, two commonly used aliases exist for the **system:running-config** and **nvram:startup-config** files; these aliases are **running-config** and **startup-config**, respectively.![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/timesave.gif)---**Timesaver** ![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)Aliases are used to reduce the amount of typing you need to perform. For example, it is easier to type **copy run start** (the abbreviated form of the **copy running-config startup-config** command) than it is to type **copy system:r nvram:s** (the abbreviated form of the **copy system:running-config nvram:startup-config** command). These aliases also allow you to continue using some of the common commands used in previous versions of Cisco IOS software.---The entire copying process may take several minutes and differs from protocol to protocol and from network to network.The colon is required after the file system URL prefix keywords (such as **flash**). In some cases, file system prefixes that did not require colons in earlier software releases are allowed for backwards compatibility, but use of the colon is recommended.In the URL syntax for **ftp:**, **http:**, **https:**, **rcp:**, **scp:** and **tftp:**, the location is either an IP address or a host name. The filename is specified relative to the directory used for file transfers.The following sections contain usage guidelines for the following topics:•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)[Understanding Invalid Combinations of Source and Destination](#wp1065124)•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)[Understanding Character Descriptions](#wp1065130)•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)[Understanding Partitions](#wp1065171)•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)[Using rcp](#wp1065175)•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)[Using FTP](#wp1065193)•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)[Using HTTP or HTTPS](#wp1065208)•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)[Storing Images on Servers](#wp1065221)•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)[Copying from a Server to Flash Memory](#wp1065225)•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)[Verifying Images](#wp1065231)•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)[Copying a Configuration File from a Server to the Running Configuration](#wp1065239)•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)[Copying a Configuration File from a Server to the Startup Configuration](#wp1065245)•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)[Storing the Running or Startup Configuration on a Server](#wp1065248)•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)[Saving the Running Configuration to the Startup Configuration](#wp1065255)•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)[Using CONFIG\\_FILE, BOOT, and BOOTLDR Environment Variables](#wp1065265)•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)[Using the Copy Command with the Dual RSP Feature](#wp1065274)•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)[Using the copy command with the ASR1000 Series Routers](#wp1065278)Understanding Invalid Combinations of Source and DestinationSome invalid combinations of source and destination exist.

Each exclamation point indicates the successful transfer of ten packets (512 bytes each). || . | For network transfers, a period indicates that the copy process timed out. Many periods in a row typically mean that the copy process may fail. || O | For network transfers, an uppercase O indicates that a packet was received out of order and the copy process may fail. || e | For flash erasures, a lowercase e indicates that a device is being erased. || E | An uppercase E indicates an error. The copy process may fail. || V | A series of uppercase Vs indicates the progress during the verification of the image checksum. |  Understanding PartitionsYou cannot copy an image or configuration file to a flash partition from which you are currently running. For example, if partition 1 is running the current system image, copy the configuration file or image to partition 2. Otherwise, the copy operation will fail.You can identify the available flash partitions by entering the **show file system**EXECcommand.Using rcpThe rcp requires a client to send a remote username upon each rcp request to a server. When you copy a configuration file or image between the router and a server using rcp, the Cisco IOS software sends the first valid username it encounters in the following sequence: **1.** ![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)The remote username specified in the **copy** command, if a username is specified. **2.** ![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)The username set by the **ip rcmd remote-username** global configuration command, if the command is configured. **3.** ![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)The remote username associated with the current tty (terminal) process. For example, if the user is connected to the router through Telnet and was authenticated through the **username** command, the router software sends the Telnet username as the remote username. **4.** ![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)The router host name.For the rcp copy request to process, an account must be defined on the network server for the remote username. If the network administrator of the destination server did not establish an account for the remote username, this command will not run. If the server has a directory structure, the configuration file or image is written to or copied from the directory associated with the remote username on the server. For example, if the system image resides in the home directory of a user on the server, specify that username as the remote username.If you are writing to the server, the rcp server must be properly configured to accept the rcp write request from the user on the router. For UNIX systems, add an entry to the *.rhosts* file for the remote user on the rcp server. Suppose the router contains the following configuration lines:```hostname Rtr1``````ip rcmd remote-username User0``````  ```If the router IP address translates to Router1.company.com, then the *.rhosts* file for User0 on the rcp server should contain the following line:```Router1.company.com Rtr1``````  ```Refer to the documentation for your rcp server for more details.If you are using a personal computer as a file server, the computer must support the remote shell protocol (rsh).Using FTPThe FTP protocol requires a client to send a username and password with each FTP request to a remote FTP server. Use the **ip ftp username** and **ip ftp password** global configuration commands to specify a default username and password for all copy operations to or from an FTP server. Include the username in the **copy** command syntax if you want to specify a username for that copy operation only.When you copy a file from the router to a server using FTP, the Cisco IOS software sends the first valid username that it encounters in the following sequence: **1.** ![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)The username specified in the **copy** command, if a username is specified. **2.** ![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)The username set by the **ip ftp username** command, if the command is configured. **3.** ![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)Anonymous.The router sends the first valid password in the following list: **1.** ![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)The password specified in the **copy** command, if a password is specified. **2.** ![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)The password set by the **ip ftp password** command, if the command is configured. **3.** ![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)The router forms a password *username*@*routername*.*domain*. The variable *username* is the username associated with the current session, *routername* is the configured host name, and *domain* is the domain of the router.The username and password must be associated with an account on the FTP server. If you are writing to the server, the FTP server must be properly configured to accept the FTP write request from the user on the router.If the server has a directory structure, the configuration file or image is written to or copied from the directory associated with the username on the server. For example, if the system image resides in the home directory of a user on the server, specify that username as the remote username.Refer to the documentation for your FTP server for details on setting up the server.Using HTTP or HTTPSCopying a file to or from a remote HTTP or HTTPS server, to or from a local file system, is performed using the embedded Secure HTTP client that is integrated in Cisco IOS software. The HTTP client is enabled by default.Downloading files from a remote HTTP or HTTPS server is performed using the HTTP client integrated in Cisco IOS software.If a username and password are not specified in the **copy** command syntax, the system uses the default HTTP client username and password, if configured.When you copy a file from a remote HTTP or HTTPS server, the Cisco IOS software sends the first valid username that it encounters in the following sequence: **1.** ![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)The username specified in the **copy** command, if a username is specified. **2.** ![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)The username set by the **ip http client username** command, if the command is configured. **3.** ![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)Anonymous.The router sends the first valid password in the following list: **1.** ![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)The password specified in the **copy** command, if a password is specified. **2.** ![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)The password set by the **ip http client password** command, if the command is configured. **3.** ![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)The router forms the password *username*@*routername*.*domain*. The variable *username* is the username associated with the current session, *routername* is the configured host name, and *domain* is the domain of the router.Storing Images on ServersUse the **copy****flash:** *destination-url* command (for example, **copy** **flash: tftp:**) to copy a system image or boot image from flash memory to a network server. You can use the copy of the image as a backup copy. Also, you can also use the image backup file to verify that the image in flash memory is the same as that in the original file.Copying from a Server to Flash MemoryUse the **copy** *destination-url* flash:command (for example, **copy** **tftp: flash:**) to copy an image from a server to flash memory.On Class B file system platforms, the system provides an option to erase existing flash memory before writing onto it.![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/note.gif)---**Note** ![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)Verify the image in flash memory before booting the image.---Verifying ImagesWhen copying a new image to your router, you should confirm that the image was not corrupted during the copy process. You can verify the integrity of the image in any of the following ways:•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)Depending on the destination file system type, a checksum for the image file may be displayed when the **copy** command completes. You can verify this checksum by comparing it to the checksum value provided for your image file on Cisco.com.![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/caut.gif)---**Caution** ![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)If the checksum values do not match, do not reboot the router. Instead, reissue the**copy** command and compare the checksums again. If the checksum is repeatedly wrong, copy the original image back into flash memory*before* you reboot the router from flash memory. If you have a corrupted image in flash memory and try to boot from flash memory, the router will start the system image contained in ROM (assuming booting from a network server is not configured). If ROM does not contain a fully functional system image, the router might not function and will need to be reconfigured through a direct console port connection.---•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)Use the **/verify** keyword.•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)Enable automatic image verification by default by issuing the **file verify auto** command. This command will automatically check the integrity of each file that is copied via the **copy** command (without specifying the **/verify** option) to the router unless the **/noverify** keyword is specified.•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)Use the UNIX 'diff' command. This method can also be applied to file types other than Cisco IOS images. If you suspect that a file is corrupted, copy the suspect file and the original file to a UNIX server. (The file names may need to be modified if you try to save the files in the same directory.) Then run the UNIX 'diff' command on the two files. If there is no difference, then the file has not been corrupted.Copying a Configuration File from a Server to the Running ConfigurationUse the **copy** {**ftp:** | **rcp:** | **scp:** | **tftp:**} **running-config** command to load a configuration file from a network server to the running configuration of the router. (Note that **running-config** is the alias for the **system:running-config** keyword.) The configuration will be added to the running configuration as if the commands were typed in the command-line interface (CLI). Thus, the resulting configuration file will be a combination of the previous running configuration and the loaded configuration file, with the loaded configuration file having precedence.You can copy either a host configuration file or a network configuration file. Accept the default value of *host* to copy and load a host configuration file containing commands that apply to one network server in particular. Enter *network* to copy and load a network configuration file containing commands that apply to all network servers on a network.Copying a Configuration File from a Server to the Startup ConfigurationUse the **copy** {**ftp:** | **rcp:** | **scp:** | **tftp:**} **nvram:startup-config** command to copy a configuration file from a network server to the router startup configuration. These commands replace the startup configuration file with the copied configuration file.Storing the Running or Startup Configuration on a ServerUse the **copy** **system:running-config** {**ftp:** | **rcp:** | **scp:** | **tftp:**} command to copy the current configuration file to a network server using FTP, rcp, scp, or TFTP. Use the **copy** **nvram:startup-config** {**ftp:** | **rcp:** | **scp:** | **tftp:**} command to copy the startup configuration file to a network server.The configuration file copy can serve as a backup copy.Saving the Running Configuration to the Startup ConfigurationUse the **copy** **system:running-config nvram:startup-config** command to copy the running configuration to the startup configuration.![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/note.gif)---**Note** ![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)Some specific commands might not get saved to NVRAM. You will need to enter these commands again if you reboot the machine. These commands are noted in the documentation. We recommend that you keep a listing of these settings so you can quickly reconfigure your router after rebooting.---If you issue the **copy** **system:running-config nvram:startup-config** command from a bootstrap system image, a warning will instruct you to indicate whether you want your previous NVRAM configuration to be overwritten and configuration commands to be lost. This warning does not appear if NVRAM contains an invalid configuration or if the previous configuration in NVRAM was generated by a bootstrap system image.On all platforms except Class A file system platforms, the **copy** **system:running-config nvram:startup-config** command copies the currently running configuration to NVRAM.On the Class A flash file system platforms, the **copy** **system:running-config nvram:startup-config** command copies the currently running configuration to the location specified by the CONFIG\\_FILE environment variable. This variable specifies the device and configuration file used for initialization. When the CONFIG\\_FILE environment variable points to NVRAM or when this variable does not exist (such as at first-time startup), the software writes the current configuration to NVRAM. If the current configuration is too large for NVRAM, the software displays a message and stops executing the command.When the CONFIG\\_FILE environment variable specifies a valid device other than **nvram:** (that is, **flash:**, **bootflash:**, **slot0:**, or **slot1:**), the software writes the current configuration to the specified device and filename, and stores a distilled version of the configuration in NVRAM. A distilled version is one that does not contain access list information. If NVRAM already contains a copy of a complete configuration, the router prompts you to confirm the copy.Using CONFIG\\_FILE, BOOT, and BOOTLDR Environment VariablesFor the Class A flash file system platforms, specifications are as follows:•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)The CONFIG\\_FILE environment variable specifies the configuration file used during router initialization.•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)The BOOT environment variable specifies a list of bootable images on various devices.•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)The BOOTLDR environment variable specifies the flash device and filename containing the rxboot image that ROM uses for booting.•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)Cisco 3600 routers do not use a dedicated boot helper image (rxboot), which many other routers use to help with the boot process. Instead, the BOOTLDR ROM monitor environment variable identifies the flash memory device and filename that are used as the boot helper; the default is the first system image in flash memory.To view the contents of environment variables, use the **show bootvar** EXEC command. To modify the CONFIG\\_FILE environment variable, use the **boot config** global configuration command. To modify the BOOTLDR environment variable, use the **boot bootldr** global configuration command. To modify the BOOT environment variable, use the **boot system** global configuration command. To save your modifications, use the **copy** **system:running-config nvram:startup-config** command.When the destination of a **copy** command is specified by the CONFIG\\_FILE or BOOTLDR environment variable, the router prompts you for confirmation before proceeding with the copy. When the destination is the only valid image in the BOOT environment variable, the router also prompts you for confirmation before proceeding with the copy.Using the Copy Command with the Dual RSP FeatureThe Dual RSP feature allows you to install two Route Switch Processor (RSP) cards in a single router on the Cisco 7507 and Cisco 7513 platforms.On a Cisco 7507 or Cisco 7513 router configured for Dual RSPs, if you copy a file to **nvram:startup-configuration** with automatic synchronization disabled, the system prompts whether you also want to copy the file to the slave startup configuration. The default answer is **yes**. If automatic synchronization is enabled, the system automatically copies the file to the slave startup configuration each time you use a **copy** command with **nvram:startup-configuration** as the destination.Using the copy command with the ASR1000 Series RoutersThe **copy** command is available in both privileged EXEC and diagnostic mode on the Cisco ASR1000 series routers. Because the **copy** command is available in diagnostic mode, it can be used to copy all types of files between directories and remote locations even in the event of an IOS failure.",
