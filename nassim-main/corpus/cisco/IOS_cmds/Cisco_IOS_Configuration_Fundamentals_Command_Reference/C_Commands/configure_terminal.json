Note that commands in this mode are written to the running configuration file as soon as you enter them (using the Enter key/Carriage Return).After you enter the **configure terminal** command, the system prompt changes from `<router-name>#` to `<router-name>(config)#`, indicating that the router is in global configuration mode. To leave global configuration mode and return to privileged EXEC mode, type **exit** or press **Ctrl-Z**.To view the changes to the configuration you have made, use the **more system:running-config** command or **show running-config** command in user EXEC or privileged EXEC mode.Configuration LockingThe first user to enter the **configure terminal lock** command acquires the configuration lock (exclusive configuration mode).",
