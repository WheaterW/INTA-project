    "ExtraInfo": "You can use the **monitor pcm-tracer capture-destination** command to specify a location to save the PCM trace information. When Cisco IOS software saves the data to network file systems, such as TFTP and FTP, it assumes the location is valid and has write access.After the PCM capture is complete, the router automatically copies the captured contents to the specified location. The filename format at the destination location is as follows:```<Configured name>_tx_<DS0 slot>_<DS0 unit>_<DS0 channel>—For TX``````<Configured name>_rx_<DS0 slot>_<DS0 unit>_<DS0 channel>—For RX``````  ```You can identify the dial feature card (DFC) channel from where the PCM is traced using the filename format.Consider the following example:```Router(config)# monitor pcm-tracer capture-destination tftp: ://223.255.254.254/benzeer/cap/cap_data``````  ```In this example, two files are created for the data corresponding to each DS0s, one for each direction (transmitter and receiver). When the **debug pcmtracer** command is enabled, the trace data is copied into the following files:•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)cap\\_data\\_tx\\_6\\_1\\_22 and**cap\\_data\\_rx\\_6\\_1\\_22**—This corresponds to the traffic flowing through DS0 6/1:22.•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)cap\\_data\\_tx\\_6\\_1\\_22 and cap\\_data\\_rx\\_6\\_1\\_22—cap\\_data\\_tx\\_6\\_1\\_22 is the data in the transmit direction (from the DFC to the system backplane) and cap\\_data\\_rx\\_6\\_1\\_22 is the data in the receiver direction (to the DFC from the system backplane).",
