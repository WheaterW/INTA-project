In Cisco IOS software images that do not provide subsystem support for the event trace function, the **monitor event-trace** command is not available.---The Cisco IOS software allows the subsystem components to define whether support for event tracing is enabled or disabled by default. The command interface for event tracing allows you to change the default two ways: using the **monitor event-trace** command in privileged EXEC mode or using the **monitor event-trace** command in global configuration mode.Additionally, default settings do not show up in the configuration file. If the subsystem software enables event tracing by default, the **monitor event-trace** *component* **enable** command will not show up in the configuration file of the networking device; however, disabling event tracing that has been enabled by default by the subsystem will create a command entry in the configuration file.![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/note.gif)---**Note** ![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)The amount of data collected from the trace depends on the trace message size configured using the **monitor event-trace** command for each instance of a trace.---To determine whether you can enable event tracing on a subsystem, use the **monitor event-traceÂ ?** commandto get a list of software components that support event tracing.To determine whether event tracing is enabled by default for the subsystem, use the **show monitor event-trace** command to display trace messages.To specify the trace call stack at tracepoints, you must first clear the trace buffer.",
