    "ExtraInfo": "When synchronous logging of unsolicited messages and debug output is turned on, unsolicited CiscoÂ IOS software output is displayed on the console or printed after solicited Cisco IOS software output is displayed or printed. This keeps unsolicited messages and debug output from being interspersed with solicited software output and prompts.![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/tip.gif)---**Tip** ![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)This command is useful for keeping system messages from interrupting your typing. By default, messages will appear immediately when they are processed by the system, and the CLI cursor will appear at the end of the displayed message. For example, the line \"Configured by console from console\" may be printed to the screen, interrupting whatever command you are currently typing. The **logging synchronous** command allows you to avoid these potentially annoying interruptions without have to turn off logging to the console entirely.---When this command is enabled, unsolicited messages and debug output are displayed on a separate line than user input. After the unsolicited messages are displayed, the CLI returns to the user prompt.![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/note.gif)---**Note** ![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)This command is also useful for allowing you to continue typing when debugging is enabled.---When specifying a severity level number, consider that for the logging system, low numbers indicate greater severity and high numbers indicate lesser severity.When a message queue limit of a terminal line is reached, new messages are dropped from the line, although these messages might be displayed on other lines. If messages are dropped, the notice *\"*%SYS-3-MSGLOST *number-of-messages* due to overflow\" follows any messages that are displayed. This notice is displayed only on the terminal that lost the messages. It is not sent to any other lines, any logging servers, or the logging buffer.![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/caut.gif)---**Caution** ![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)By configuring abnormally large message queue limits and setting the terminal to \"terminal monitor\" on a terminal that is accessible to intruders, you expose yourself to \"denial of service\" attacks. An intruder could carry out the attack by putting the terminal in synchronous output mode, making a Telnet connection to a remote host, and leaving the connection idle. This could cause large numbers of messages to be generated and queued, and these messages could consume all available RAM. You should guard against this type of attack through proper configuration.---",
