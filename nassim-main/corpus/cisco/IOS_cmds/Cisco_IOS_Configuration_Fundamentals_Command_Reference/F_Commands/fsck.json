    "ExtraInfo": "Supported Platforms Other than Cisco 7600 Series RouterThis command performs all steps necessary to remove corrupted files and reclaim unused disk space. Changes include checking for incorrect file sizes, cluster loops, and so on. The default form of this command issues multiple prompts to confirm each of the changes. However, you can skip these prompts by using the **/automatic** keyword when issuing the command.When you use the **/automatic** keyword you are prompted to confirm that you want the automatic option. Prompts for actions will be skipped, but all actions performed are displayed to the terminal (see the example below).This command works with ATA Personal Computer Memory Card Industry Association (PCMCIA) cards formatted in Disk Operating System (DOS), or for Class C flash file systems.![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/note.gif)---**Note** ![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)Only one partition (the active partition) is checked in the ATA disk.---Cisco 7600 Series RouterThe disk0: or slavedisk0: file systems are the only file systems in the CiscoÂ 7600 series routers on which you can run the File-System-Check (fsck) utility. The slavedisk0**:** file system appears in redundant supervisor engine systems only.This command is valid only on Class C flash file systems and only on PCMCIA ATA flash disks and CompactFlash disks.The output for the **fsck slavedisk0:** command is similar to the **fsck disk0:** command output.If you do not enter any arguments, the current file system is used. Use the **pwd** command to display the current file system.If you enter the **disk0:** or **slavedisk0:** keyword, the fsck utility checks the selected file system for problems. If a problem is detected, a prompt is displayed asking if you want the problem fixed.If you enter the **/automatic** keyword, you are prompted to confirm that you want the automatic mode. In automatic mode, problems are fixed automatically and you are not prompted to confirm.If you do not specify the **/force** keyword, any simultaneous file operations on the same device are not terminated. Instead, an error message stating files are open for read or write access appears. If you specify the **/force** keyword, the fsck utility terminates files that are open for read or write access and continues to check for problems.[TableÂ 32](#wp1050039) lists the checks and actions that are performed by the fsck utility.TableÂ 32 fsck Utility Checks and Actions| Checks | Actions || --- | --- || Checks the boot sector and the partition table and reports the errors. | No action. || Validates the media with the signature in the last 2Â bytes of the first sector (0x55 and 0xaa, respectively). | No action. || Checks the os\\_id to find whether this is a FAT-12 or FAT-16 file system (valid values include 0, 1, 4, andÂ 6). | No action. || Checks the number of FAT's field (correct values are 1 and 2). | No action. || Checks these values:  â¢n\\_fat\\_sectors cannot be less than 1.  â¢n\\_root\\_entries cannot be less than 16.  â¢n\\_root\\_sectors cannot be less than 2.  â¢base\\_fat\\_sector, n\\_sectors\\_per\\_cluster, n\\_heads, n\\_sectors\\_per\\_track is not 0. | No action. || Checks the files and FAT for these errors: | || Checks the FAT for invalid cluster numbers. | If the cluster is a part of a file chain, the cluster is changed to end of file (EOF).
