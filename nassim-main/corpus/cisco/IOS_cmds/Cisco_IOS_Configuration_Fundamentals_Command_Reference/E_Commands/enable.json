    "ExtraInfo": "By default, using the **enable** command without the *privilege-level* argument in user EXEC mode causes the router to enter privileged EXEC mode (privilege-level 15).Entering privileged EXEC mode enables the use of privileged commands. Because many of the privileged commands set operating parameters, privileged access should be password-protected to prevent unauthorized use. If the system administrator has set a password with the **enable password**global configuration command, you are prompted to enter the password before being allowed access to privileged EXEC mode. The password is case sensitive.If an **enable** password has not been set, only enable mode can be accessed through the console connection.Security levels can be set by an administrator using the **enable password** and **privilege level** commands. Up to 16 privilege levels can be specified, using the numbers 0 through 15. Using these privilege levels, the administrator can allow or deny access to specific commands. Privilege level 0 is associated with user EXEC mode, and privilege level 15 is associated with privileged EXEC mode.For more information on defined privilege levels, see the *Cisco IOS* *Security Configuration Guide*Â and the *Cisco IOS Security Command Reference* publications.If a level is not specified when entering the **enable** command, the user will enter the default mode of privileged EXEC (level 15).Accessing a CLI ViewCLI views restrict user access to specified CLI and configuration information. To configure and access CLI views, users must first enter into root view, which is accomplished via the **enable view** command (without the *view-name* argument). Thereafter, users are prompted for a password, which is the same password as the privilege level 15 password.The *view-name* argument is used to switch from one view to another view.To prevent dictionary attacks, a user is prompted for a password even if an incorrect view name is given. The user is denied access only after an incorrect view name and password are given.",
