    "ExtraInfo": "Use this command to execute a command on one or all line cards to monitor and maintain information on one or more line cards (for example, a line card in a specified slot on a dial shelf). This allows you to issue commands remotely; that is, to issue commands without needing to log in to the line card directly. The **all** form of the command allows you to issue commands to all the line cards without having to log in to each in turn.Though this command does not have a **no** form, note that it is possible to use the **no** form of the remotely executed commands used in this command.![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/tip.gif)---**Tip** ![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)This command is useful when used with **show** EXEC commands (such as **show version**), because you can verify and troubleshoot the features found only on a specific line card. Please note, however, that because not all statistics are maintained on the line cards, the output from some of the **show** commands might not be consistent.---Cisco 12000 GSR Guidelines and RestrictionsYou can use the **execute-on** privileged EXEC command only from Cisco IOS software running on the GRP card.![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/timesave.gif)---**Timesaver** ![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)Though you can use the **attach** privileged EXEC command to execute commands on a specific line card, using the **execute-on** **slot** command saves you some steps. For example, first you must use the **attach** command to connect to the Cisco IOS software running on the line card. Next you must issue the command. Finally you must disconnect from the line card to return to the Cisco IOS software running on the GRP card. With the **execute-on** **slot** command, you can perform three steps with one command. In addition, the **execute-on** **all** command allows you to perform the same command on all line cards simultaneously.---Cisco AS5800 Guidelines and RestrictionsThe purpose of the command is to conveniently enable certain commands to be remotely executed on the dial shelf cards from the router without connecting to each line card. This is the recommended procedure, because it avoids the possibility of adversely affecting a good configuration of a line card in the process. The **execute-on** command does not give access to every Cisco IOS command available on the Cisco AS5800 access server. In general, the purpose of the **execute-on** command is to provide access to statistical reports from line cards without directly connecting to the dial shelf line cards.![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/caut.gif)---**Caution** ![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)Do not use this command to change configurations on dial shelf cards, because such changes will not be reflected in the router shelf.---Using this command makes it possible to accumulate inputs for inclusion in the **show tech-support** command.The **master** form of the command can run a designated command remotely on the router from the DSC card. However, using the console on the DSC is *not* recommended. It is used for technical support troubleshooting only.The **show tech-support** command for each dial shelf card is bundled into the router shelf's **show tech-support** command via the **execute-on** facility.The **execute-on** command also support interactive commands such as the following:```router: execute-on slave slot slot ping``````  ```The **execute-on** command has the same limitations and restrictions as a **vty telnet** client has; that is, it cannot reload DSC using the following command:```router: execute-on slave slot slot reload``````  ```You can use the **execute-on** command to enable remote execution of the commands included in the following partial list:•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)**debug dsc clock**•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)**show context**•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)**show diag**•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)**show environment**•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)**show dsc clock**•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)**show dsi**•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)**show dsip**•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)**show tech-support**",
