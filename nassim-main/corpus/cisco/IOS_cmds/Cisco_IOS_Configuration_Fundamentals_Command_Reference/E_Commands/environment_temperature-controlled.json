    "ExtraInfo": "This command does not affect temperature monitoring and alarm thresholds; it only affects whether a module may be powered on. The software does not validate the inlet temperature.If you enter the **no** form of this command and the cooling capacity is reduced below the module cooling requirement, a syslog warning (and SNMP alarm) is generated. This module status does not change, and an environmental alarm is not raised when you enter the **no** form of this command.",
