It is not visible from the route processor (RP) console.For both the ES+ line cards and the SIP-400, setting the police rate to 0 turns off the policing.For both the ES+ line cards and the SIP-400, when the policer is set from the the line card console, the setting remains effective even if the line card is moved to another chassis running the Cisco IOS Release 12.2(33)SRD1 (or later) image.For the SIP-400, IPv6 HBH packets will continue to go through the QoS policing configured on the line card. For ES+ line cards, IPv6 HBH packets will bypass any QoS configured on the line card.",
