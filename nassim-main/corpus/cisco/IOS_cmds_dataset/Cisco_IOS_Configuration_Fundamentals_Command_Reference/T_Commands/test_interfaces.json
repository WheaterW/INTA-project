    "ExtraInfo": "The **test interfaces** EXEC command is intended for the factory checkout of network interfaces. It is not intended for diagnosing problems with an operational router. The **test interfaces** output does not report correct results if the router is attached to a \"live\" network. For each network interface that has an IP address that can be tested in loopback (MCI and ciscoBus Ethernet and all serial interfaces), the **test interfaces** command sends a series of ICMP echoes. Error counters are examined to determine the operational status of the interface.",
