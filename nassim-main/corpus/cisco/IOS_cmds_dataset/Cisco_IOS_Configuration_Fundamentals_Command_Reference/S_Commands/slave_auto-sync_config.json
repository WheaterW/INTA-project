    "ExtraInfo": "Use this command for a Cisco 7507 or Cisco 7513 router that is configured for dual RSP cards. On the CiscoÂ 7507 and Cisco 7513 router, you can install two RSP cards in a single router to improve system availability. Dual RSP Cards is a High System Availability (HSA) feature.In automatic synchronization mode, when you issue a **copy** EXEC command that specifies the master's startup configuration (**nvram:startup-config**) as the target, the master also copies the same file to the slave's startup configuration (**slavenvram:startup-config**). Use this command when implementing HSA for simple hardware backup or for software error protection to ensure that the master and slave RSP contain the same configuration files.",
