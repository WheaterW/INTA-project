    "ExtraInfo": "To use the **service tcp-small-servers** command, you must be in a user group associated with a task group that includes the proper task IDs. If you suspect user group assignment is preventing you from using a command, contact your Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) administrator for assistance.The TCP small servers consist of three services: Discard (port 9), Echo (port 7), and Chargen (port 19). These services are used to test the TCP transport functionality. The discard server receives data and discards it. The echo server receives data and echoes the same data to the sending host. The chargen server generates a sequence of data and sends it to the remote host.",
