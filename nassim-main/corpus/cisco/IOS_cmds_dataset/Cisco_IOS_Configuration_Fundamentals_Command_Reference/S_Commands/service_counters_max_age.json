    "ExtraInfo": "A fully loaded Catalyst 6500 series switch chassis running Cisco IOS software version 12.2(18)SXF or its minor variants (SXF through SXF5) takes 1-2 minutes to update the SNMP counters maintained under ifTable and ifXTable.Polling the ifTable/ifXTable is done with the need to understand how much traffic is being handled by a specific port/interface. The typical polling interval to meet this need is 3-5 minutes. No gain is achived by reducing the polling interval to intervals lesser than 3 minutes.![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/note.gif)---**Note** ![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)If you decrease the time interval for retrieving statistics from the default setting (5 seconds), traffic congestion may result in situations where frequent SNMP (SMNP bulk) retrievals occur.---",
