Memory\" requirement for a software image. DRAM (including SDRAM) is used for system processing memory and for packet memory. Two values, separated by a slash, are given for DRAM: The first value tells you how DRAM is available for system processing, and the second value tells you how much DRAM is being used for Packet memory. The first value, Main Processor memory, is either: •The amount of DRAM available for the processor, or •The total amount of DRAM installed on the system. The second value, Packet memory, is either: •The total physical input/output (I/O) memory (or \"Fast memory\") installed on the router (Cisco 4000, 4500, 4700, and 7500 series), or •The amount of \"shared memory\" used for packet buffering. In the shared memory scheme (Cisco 2500, 2600, 3600, and 7200 Series), a percentage of DRAM is used for packet buffering by the router's network interfaces. Note The terms \"I/O memory\" or \"iomem\"; \"shared memory\"; \"Fast memory\" and \"PCI memory\" all refer to \"Packet Memory\". Packet memory is either separate physical RAM or shared DRAM. Separate DRAM and Packet Memory The 4000, 4500, 4700, and 7500 series routers have separate DRAM and Packet memory, so you only need to look at the first number to determine total DRAM. In the example to the left for the Cisco RSP4, the first value shows that the router has 65536K (65,536 kilobytes, or 64 megabytes) of DRAM. The second value, 8192K, is the Packet memory. Combined DRAM and Packet Memory The 2500, 2600, 3600, and 7200 series routers require a minimum amount of I/O memory to support certain interface processors. The 1600, 2500, 2600, 3600, and 7200 series routers use a fraction of DRAM as Packet memory, so you need to add both numbers to find out the real amount of DRAM. In the example to the left for the Cisco 3660, the router has 57,344 kilobytes (KB) of free DRAM and 8,192 KB dedicated to Packet memory. Adding the two numbers together gives you 57,344K + 8,192K = 65,536K, or 64 megabytes (MB) of DRAM. |",

If the value has been changed with the config-register command, the register value that will be used at the next reload is displayed in parenthesis. The boot field (final digit) of the software configuration register dictates what the system will do after a reset. For example, when the boot field of the software configuration register is set to 00 (for example, 0x0), and you press the NMI button on a Performance Route Processor (PRP), the user-interface remains at the ROM monitor prompt (rommon>) and waits for a user command to boot the system manually. But if the boot field is set to 01 (for example, 0x1), the system automatically boots the first Cisco IOS image found in the onboard Flash memory SIMM on the PRP. The factory-default setting for the configuration register is 0x2102. This value indicates that the router will attempt to load a Cisco IOS software image from Flash memory and load the startup configuration file. |",

    "ExtraInfo": "This command displays information about the Cisco IOS software version currently running on a routing device, the ROM Monitor and Bootflash software versions, and information about the hardware configuration, including the amount of system memory. Because this command displays both software and hardware information, the output of this command is the same as the output of the **show hardware** command. (The **show hardware** command is a command alias for the **show version** command.)Specifically, the **show version** command provides the following information:•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)Software information–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)Main Cisco IOS image version–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)Main Cisco IOS image capabilities (feature set)–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)Location and name of bootfile in ROM–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)Bootflash image version (depending on platform)•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)Device-specific information–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)Device name–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)System uptime–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)System reload reason–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)Config-register setting–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)Config-register settings for after the next reload (depending on platform)•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)Hardware information–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)Platform type–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)Processor type–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)Processor hardware revision–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)Amount of main (processor) memory installed–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)Amount I/O memory installed–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)Amount of Flash memory installed on different types (depending on platform)–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)Processor board IDThe output of this command uses the following format:```Cisco IOS Software, <platform> Software (<image-id>), Version <software-version>,  <software-type>``````Technical Support: http://www.cisco.com/techsupport``````Copyright (c) <date-range> by Cisco Systems, Inc.``````Compiled <day> <date> <time> by <compiler-id>``````  ``````ROM: System Bootstrap, Version <software-version>,  <software-type>``````BOOTLDR: <platform> Software (image-id), Version <software-version>,  <software-type>``````  ``````<router-name> uptime is <w> weeks, <d> days, <h> hours, <m> minutes``````System returned to ROM by reload at <time> <day> <date>``````System image file is \"<filesystem-location>/<software-image-name>\"``````Last reload reason: <reload-reason>``````  ``````Cisco <platform-processor-type> processor (revision <processor-revision-id>) with <free-DRAM-memory>K/<packet-memory>K bytes of memory.``````Processor board ID <ID-number>``````<CPU-type> CPU at <clock-speed>Mhz, Implementation <number>, Rev <Revision-number>, <kilobytes-Processor-Cache-Memory>KB <cache-Level> Cache``````  ```See the Examples section for descriptions of the fields in this output.Cisco ASR 1000 Series RoutersEntering **show version** without any of the options on the Cisco ASR 1000 Series Router will generate output similar to **show version** on other Cisco routers.In order to understand the **show version** output on Cisco ASR 1000 Series Routers, it is important to understand that the individual sub-packages run the processes on the router. Among other things, the output of this command provides information on where various individual sub-packages are stored on the router, and which processes these individual sub-packages are and are not currently running.More specifically, the **show version installed** command displays each individual sub-package file on the router, the hardware where the sub-package could be running, and whether the sub-package is currently being run on that hardware.The **show version provisioned** command displays only the individual sub-packages that can be provisioned, which are the RP-specific sub-packages (RP Access, RP Base, RP Control, and RP IOS) and the provisioning file. The output includes the individual sub-package file, the hardware where the sub-package could be running, and whether the sub-package is currently being run on that hardware.The **show version running** command displays only the individual sub-packages that are currently active. The output includes the individual sub-package file and the hardware where the sub-package is running.",
