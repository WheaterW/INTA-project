    "ExtraInfo": "The **show memory debug incremental allocations** command displays all the memory blocks that were allocated after the **set memory debug incremental starting-time** command was entered. The displayed memory blocks are just memory allocations, they are not necessarily leaks.The **show memory debug incremental leaks** command provides output similar to the **show memory debug leaks** command, except that it displays only memory that was leaked after the **set memory debug incremental starting-time** command was entered.The **show memory debug incremental leaks lowmem**command forces memory leak detection to work in low memory mode. The amount of time taken for analysis is considerably greater than that of normal mode. The output for this command is similar to the **show memory debug leaks** command, except that it displays only memory that was leaked after the **set memory debug incremental starting-time** command was entered. You can use this command when you already know that normal mode memory leak detection will fail (perhaps by an unsuccessful previous attempt to invoke normal mode memory leak detection).The **show memory debug incremental leaks summary** command displays a summarized report of the memory that was leaked after the **set memory debug incremental starting-time** command was entered, ordered by allocator process call address (Alloc\\_pc) and by memory block size.The **show memory debug incremental status** command displays whether a starting point for incremental analysis has been set and the elapsed time since then.![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/note.gif)---**Note** ![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)All show memory debug commands must be used on customer networks only to diagnose the router for memory leaks when memory depletion is observed. These CLI's will have high CPU utilization and might result in time sensitive protocols to flap. These CLI's are recommended for customer use, only in the maintenance window when the router is not in a scaled condition.---![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/note.gif)---**Note** ![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)All memory leak detection commands invoke normal mode memory leak detection, except when the low memory option is specifically invoked by use of the **lowmem** keyword. In normal mode, if memory leak detection determines that there is insufficient memory to proceed in normal mode, it will display an appropriate message and switch to low memory mode.---",
