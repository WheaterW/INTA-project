    "ExtraInfo": "This command runs on the privileged EXEC mode. To enter the privileged EXEC mode, type **enable** in the user EXEC mode and press Enter. Provide a password, if prompted.This command displays the state of syslog error and event logging, including host addresses, and which logging destinations (console, monitor, buffer, or host) logging is enabled. This command also displays Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) logging configuration parameters and protocol activity.This command will also display the contents of the standard system logging buffer, if logging to the buffer is enabled. Logging to the buffer is enabled or disabled using the [**no**] **logging buffered** command. The number of system error and debugging messages in the system logging buffer is determined by the configured size of the syslog buffer. This size of the syslog buffer is also set using the **logging buffered** command.To enable and set the format for syslog message time stamping, use the **service timestamps log** command.If debugging is enabled (using any **debug** command), and the logging buffer is configured to include level 7 (debugging) messages, debug output will be included in the system log. Debugging output is not formatted like system error messages and will not be preceded by the percent symbol (%).",
