    "ExtraInfo": "To enable the error log count capability (syslog counting feature), use the **logging count** command in global configuration mode.This feature works independently of the various settings of the other logging commands (such as [**no**] **logging on**, [**no**] **logging buffered**, and so on). In other words, turning off logging by other means does not stop the counting and timestamping from occuring.This command displays information such as the number of times a particular system error message occurs and the time stamp of the last occurrence of the specified message. System error messages are grouped into logical units called \"Facilities\" based on Cisco IOS software components.To determine if system error message counting is enabled, use the **show logging** command.The **service timestamps** command configuration determines the timestamp format (shown in the \"Last Time\" column) of **show logging count** command output. There is not quite enough space for all options of the possible options (datetime, milliseconds, and timezone) of the **service timestamps datetime** command to be displayed at the same time. As a result, if **msec** is selected, **timezone** will not be displayed. If **show-timezone** is selected but not **msec**, then the time zone will be displayed.Occasionally, the length of the message name plus the facility name contains too many characters to be printed on one line. The CLI attempts to keep the name and facility name on one line but, if necessary, the line will be wrapped, so that the first line contains the facility name and the second line contains the message name and the rest of the columns.",
