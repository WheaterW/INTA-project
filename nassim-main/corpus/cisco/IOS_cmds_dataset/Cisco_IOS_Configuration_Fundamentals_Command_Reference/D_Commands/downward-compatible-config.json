Use the **downward-compatible-config** command to regenerate a configuration in a format prior to Release 10.3 if you will downgrade from your software version to version 10.2 or 10.3. The earliest *version* value this command accepts isÂ 10.2.When this command is configured, the router attempts to generate a configuration that is compatible with the specified version. Note that this command affects only IP access lists.Under some circumstances, the software might not be able to generate a fully backward-compatible configuration. In such a case, the software issues a warning message.",
