    "ExtraInfo": "The Memory Scan feature adds a low-priority background process that searches all installed dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) for possible parity errors. If errors are found in memory areas that are not in use, this feature attempts to scrub (remove) the errors. The time to complete one memory scan and scrub cycle can range from 10 minutes to several hours, depending on the amount of installed memory. The impact of the Memory Scan feature on the central processing unit (CPU) is minimal. To view the status of the memory scan feature on your router, use the **show memory scan** command in EXEC mode.",
