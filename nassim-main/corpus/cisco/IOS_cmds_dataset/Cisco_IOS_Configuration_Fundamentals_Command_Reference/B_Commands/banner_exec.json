    "ExtraInfo": "This command specifies a message to be displayed when an EXEC process is created (a line is activated, or an incoming connection is made to a vty). Follow this command with one or more blank spaces and a delimiting character of your choice. Then enter one or more lines of text, terminating the message with the second occurrence of the delimiting character.When a user connects to a router, the message-of-the-day (MOTD) banner appears first, followed by the login banner and prompts. After the user logs in to the router, the EXEC banner or incoming banner will be displayed, depending on the type of connection. For a reverse Telnet login, the incoming banner will be displayed. For all other connections, the router will display the EXEC banner.To disable the EXEC banner on a particular line or lines, use the **no** **exec-banner** line configuration command.To customize the banner, use tokens in the form $(*token*) in the message text. Tokens will display current Cisco IOS configuration variables, such as the router's host name and IP address. The tokens are described in [Table 13](#wp1014213).Table 13 banner exec Tokens| Token | Information Displayed in the Banner || --- | --- || **$(hostname)** | Displays the host name for the router. || **$(domain)** | Displays the domain name for the router. || **$(line)** | Displays the vty or tty (asynchronous) line number. || **$(line-desc)** | Displays the description attached to the line. |  ",
