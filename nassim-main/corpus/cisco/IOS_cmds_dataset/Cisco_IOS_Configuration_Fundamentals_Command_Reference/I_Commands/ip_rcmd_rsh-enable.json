    "ExtraInfo": "rsh, used as a client process, gives users the ability to remotely get router information (such as status) without the need to connect into the router and then disconnect. This is valuable when looking at many statistics on many different routers.Use this command to enable the router to receive rsh requests from remote users. In addition to issuing this command, you must create an entry for the remote user in the local authentication database to allow a remote user to execute rsh commands on the router.The **no** **ip rcmd rsh-enable**command does not prohibit a local user of the router from executing a command on other routers and UNIX hosts on the network using rsh. The no form of this command only disables remote access to rsh on the router.",
