    "ExtraInfo": "The **ping** command sends an echo request packet to an address then waits for a reply. Ping output can help you evaluate path-to-host reliability, delays over the path, and whether the host can be reached or is functioning. For example, the **ping clns** command sends International Organization for Standardization (ISO) CLNS echo packets to test the reachability of a remote router over a connectionless Open System Interconnection (OSI) network.If you enter the **ping** command without any keywords or argument values, an interactive system dialog prompts you for the additional syntax appropriate to the protocol you specify. (See the \"Examples\" section.)To exit the interactive ping dialog before responding to all the prompts, type the escape sequence. The default escape sequence is **Ctrl**-**^**, **X** (Simultaneously press and release the **Ctrl**, **Shift**, and **6** keys and then press the **X** key). The escape sequence will vary depending on your line configuration. For example, another commonly used escape sequence is **Ctrl**-**c**.[Table 40](#wp1013921) describes the test characters sent by the **ping** facility.Table 40 **ping** Test Characters| Character | Description || --- | --- || ! | Each exclamation point indicates receipt of a reply. || . | Each period indicates that the network server timed out while waiting for a reply. || U | A destination unreachable error protocol data unit (PDU) was received. || C | A congestion experienced packet was received. || I | User interrupted test. || M | A destination unreachable error protocol data unit (PDU) was received (Type 3) MTU required but DF bit set (code 4) with the \"Next-Hop MTU\" set to a non-zero value. If the \"Next-hop MTU\" is zero then `U' is printed. || ? | Unknown packet type. || & | Packet lifetime exceeded. |  ![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/note.gif)---**Note** ![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)Not all protocols require hosts to support pings. For some protocols, the pings are Cisco defined and can be answered only by another Cisco router.---The availability of protocol keywords depends on what protocols are enabled on your system.Issuing the **ping** command in user EXEC mode will generally offer fewer syntax options than issuing the **ping** command in privileged EXEC mode.",
