    "ExtraInfo": "Follow the **banner incoming** command with one or more blank spaces and a delimiting character of your choice. Then enter one or more lines of text, terminating the message with the second occurrence of the delimiting character.An *incoming connection* is one initiated from the network side of the router. Incoming connections are also called reverse Telnet sessions. These sessions can display MOTD banners and incoming banners, but they do not display EXEC banners. Use the **no** **motd-banner** line configuration command to disable the MOTD banner for reverse Telnet sessions on asynchronous lines.When a user connects to the router, the message-of-the-day (MOTD) banner (if configured) appears first, before the login prompt. After the user successfully logs in to the router, the EXEC banner or incoming banner will be displayed, depending on the type of connection. For a reverse Telnet login, the incoming banner will be displayed. For all other connections, the router will display the EXEC banner.Incoming banners cannot be suppressed. If you do not want the incoming banner to appear, you must delete it with the **no** **banner incoming** command.To customize the banner, use tokens in the form $(*token*) in the message text. Tokens will display current Cisco IOS configuration variables, such as the router's host name and IP address. The tokens are described in [Table 14](#wp1014344).Table 14 banner incoming Tokens| Token | Information Displayed in the Banner || --- | --- || **$(hostname)** | Displays the host name for the router. || **$(domain)** | Displays the domain name for the router. || **$(line)** | Displays the vty or tty (asynchronous) line number. || **$(line-desc)** | Displays the description attached to the line. |  ",
