    "ExtraInfo": "By default, when the software sends a request that requires a response from a MOP boot server and the server does not respond, the message is re-sent after 4 seconds. If the MOP boot server and router are separated by a slow serial link, it might take longer than 4 seconds for the software to receive a response to its message. Therefore, you might want to configure the software to wait longer than 4 seconds before resending the message if you are using such a link.",
