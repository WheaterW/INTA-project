    "ExtraInfo": "The **menu title** command must use the same menu name used with the **menu text** and **menu command** commands used to create a menu.You can position the title of the menu horizontally by preceding the title text with blank characters. You can also add lines of space above and below the title by pressing Enter.Follow the **title** keyword with one or more blank characters and a delimiting character of your choice. Then enter one or more lines of text, ending the title with the same delimiting character. You cannot use the delimiting character within the text of the message.When you are configuring from a terminal and are attempting to include special control characters, such as a screen-clearing string, you must use Ctrl-V before the special control characters so that they are accepted as part of the title string. The string ^[[H^[[J is an escape string used by many VT100-compatible terminals to clear the screen. To use a special string, you must enter Ctrl-V before each escape character.You also can use the **menu clear-screen** global configuration command to clear the screen before displaying menus and submenus, instead of embedding a terminal-specific string in the menu title. The **menu clear-screen** command allows the same menu to be used on different types of terminals.",
