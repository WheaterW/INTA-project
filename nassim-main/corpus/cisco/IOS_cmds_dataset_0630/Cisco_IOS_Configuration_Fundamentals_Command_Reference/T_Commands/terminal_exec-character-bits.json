    "ExtraInfo": "This EXEC command overrides the **default-value exec-character-bits** global configuration command. Configuring the EXEC character width to 8 bits enables you to view special graphical and international characters in banners, prompts, and so on.When the user exits the session, the character width is reset to the default value established by the **exec-character-bits** global configuration command. However, setting the EXEC character width to 8Â bits can also cause failures. For example, if a user on a terminal that is sending parity enters the **help** command, an \"unrecognized command\" message appears because the system is reading all 8 bits, and the eighth bit is not needed for the **help** command.",
