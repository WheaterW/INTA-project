    "ExtraInfo": "Communication protocols provided by devices such as terminals and modems often require a specific data bit setting. The **terminal databits** command can be used to mask the high bit on input from devices that generate 7 data bits with parity. If parity is being generated, specify 7 data bits per character. If no parity generation is in effect, specify 8 data bits per character. The other keywords (**5** and **6**) are supplied for compatibility with older devices and are generally not used.",
