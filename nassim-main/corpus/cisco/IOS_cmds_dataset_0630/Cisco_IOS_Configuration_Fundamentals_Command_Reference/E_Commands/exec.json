(For example, the control port of a rack of modems attached to an auxiliary port of router.) When certain types of data are sent to a line connection, an EXEC process can start, which makes the line unavailable.When a user tries to Telnet to a line with the EXEC process disabled, the user will get no response when attempting to log on.",
