    "ExtraInfo": "Normally, data sent to noncurrent Telnet connections is accepted and discarded. When the **serviceÂ telnet-zero-idle** command is enabled, if a session is suspended (that is, some other connection is made active or the router is in the privileged EXEC mode), the TCP window is set to zero. This action prevents the remote host from sending any more data until the connection is resumed. Use this command when it is important that all messages sent by the host be seen by the users and the users are likely to use multiple sessions.Do not use this command if your host will eventually time out and log out a TCP user whose window is zero.",
