The keyword is slot x for a full-height line card, slot x/y for a half-height card, and bay x/y for a SPA.To monitor a diagnostic test periodically, you first need to configure the hours, minutes, and seconds interval to run the diagnostic test using the **diagnostic monitor interval** command. An error message is displayed, if the interval is not configured before enabling the monitoring.To store log details for failed tests, execute the **diagnostic monitor syslog** command. A threshold value to specify the maximum count for allowed failures is configured using the **diagnostic monitor threshold** command. The failed test results can be viewed using the **show diagnostic results** command, after the number of failed test reaches the maximum number of allowed failures configured using the **diagnostic monitor threshold** command.",
