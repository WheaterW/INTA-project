    "ExtraInfo": "The **copy ymodem:** and **copy ymodem** commands are identical. See the description of the **copy** command for more information.Copying a file using FTP, rcp, or TFTP is much faster than copying a file using Ymodem. Use the **copy ymodem:**command only if you do not have access to an FTP, rcp, or TFTP server.This copy operation is performed through the console or AUX port. The AUX port, which supports hardware flow control, is recommended.No output is displayed on the port over which the transfer is occurring. You can use the **logging buffered** command to log all router messages sent to the console port during the file transfer.",
