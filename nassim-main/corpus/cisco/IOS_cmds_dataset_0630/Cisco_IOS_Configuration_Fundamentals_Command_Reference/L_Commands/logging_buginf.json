    "ExtraInfo": "The **no logging buginf** command is used to avoid a situation where a large amount of debug messages might overload the processor (CPU hog condition). This condition differs from the use of the **undebug all** command wherein all debugging calls are disabled in the Cisco IOS software. No debug reporting is available, even if debugging is enabled. Note that even though debugging has been completely disabled in the system, other message reporting, including error reporting, is still available.",
