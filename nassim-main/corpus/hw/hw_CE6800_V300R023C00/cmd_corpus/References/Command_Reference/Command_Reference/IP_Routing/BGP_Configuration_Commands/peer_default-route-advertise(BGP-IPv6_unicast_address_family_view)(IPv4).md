peer default-route-advertise(BGP-IPv6 unicast address family view)(IPv4)
========================================================================

peer default-route-advertise(BGP-IPv6 unicast address family view)(IPv4)

Function
--------



The **peer default-route-advertise** command configures a device to advertise default routes to its peer.

The **undo peer default-route-advertise** command restores the default configuration.



By default, a BGP device does not advertise any default route to its peer.

Format
------

**peer** *ipv4-address* **default-route-advertise** [ **route-policy** *route-policy-name* ]

**peer** *ipv4-address* **default-route-advertise** [ **route-policy** *route-policy-name* ] { **conditional-route-match-all** | **conditional-route-match-any** } { *ipv6-address* *mask-length* } &<1-4>

**undo peer** *ipv4-address* **default-route-advertise**


Parameters
----------

| Parameter | Description | Value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| *ipv4-address* | Specifies an IPv4 peer address. | The value is in dotted decimal notation. |
| **route-policy** *route-policy-name* | Specifies the name of the route-policy. | The value is a string of 1 to 200 case-sensitive characters without spaces. The character string can contain spaces if it is enclosed with double quotation marks ("). |
| **conditional-route-match-all** | The default routes are sent to the peer group only when all the conditional routes are matched. | - |
| **conditional-route-match-any** | Configures the device to send the default route when any conditional route is matched. | - |
| *ipv6-address* | Specifies the IPv6 address of a conditional route. | The format is X:X:X:X:X:X:X:X. |
| *mask-length* | Specifies the IPv6 mask length of a conditional route. | It is an integer ranging from 0 to 128. |

Usage Guidelines
----------------

**Usage Scenario**

Default routes are usually used on networks with the following characteristics:

* There are multiple EBGP peers, and full Internet routes are received from each peer.
* There are multiple RRs, and each RR receives full Internet routes.If load balancing is not performed on a network, a BGP peer receives at most one copy of active full Internet routes. If load balancing is performed on a network, the number of active routes received by a BGP peer increases sharply, causing the number of routes on the network to sharply increase.On such a network, you can configure the device to advertise default routes to BGP peers and use default routes for load balancing to reduce the number of routes on the network.This command does not require that a default route exist in the routing table. Instead, the device unconditionally sends a default route with the next hop being itself to the peer.

**Precautions**

This command enables the device to advertise the default route generated by itself, and condition-based matching is not used. Therefore, you are not advised to configure if-match clauses in a route-policy.


Example
-------

# Configure a BGP device to advertise default routes to its peer.
```
<HUAWEI> system-view
[~HUAWEI] bgp 100
[*HUAWEI-bgp] peer 10.1.1.2 as-number 200
[*HUAWEI-bgp] ipv6-family unicast
[*HUAWEI-bgp-af-ipv6] peer 10.1.1.2 enable
[*HUAWEI-bgp-af-ipv6] peer 10.1.1.2 default-route-advertise

```
