The **ipv6 preference** command sets a priority for the IPv6 routes generated by IS-IS.

The **undo ipv6 preference** command restores the default value.



By default, the priority for the IPv6 routes generated by IS-IS is 15.

Usage Guidelines
----------------

**Usage Scenario**

Multiple dynamic routing protocols can be run on a device. In this case, set a default priority for each routing protocol. If different protocols have routes to the same destination, the route with the highest priority is selected for IP packet forwarding.You can set a priority only for specific routes matching a route-policy. For the route that matches the route-policy, the priority set in the route-policy is preferred to the priority set using the ipv6 preference command. If no priority is set in the route-policy or the ipv6 preference command is not run, the default priority is used.

**Prerequisites**

IPv6 has been enabled for the IS-IS process. For details, see isis ipv6 enable.

**Precautions**

When a device runs multiple routing protocols at the same time, changing the IS-IS preference may change the inter-protocol route selection result in the routing table.


Example
-------

# Set the priority for the IPv6 routes generated by IS-IS to 20.
```
<HUAWEI> system-view
[~HUAWEI] isis
[*HUAWEI-isis-1] ipv6 enable
[*HUAWEI-isis-1] ipv6 preference 20

```
