peer keychain (BGP-VPN instance IPv6 address family view) (group)
=================================================================

peer keychain (BGP-VPN instance IPv6 address family view) (group)

Function
--------



The **peer keychain** command configures the Keychain authentication for establishing the TCP connection between BGP peers.

The **undo peer keychain** command deletes the Keychain authentication.



By default, the Keychain authentication is not performed during TCP connection establishment between peers.

This command is supported only on the CE6863H, CE6863H-K, CE6860-SAN, CE6866K, CE6866, CE6860-HAM, CE6855-48XS8CQ, CE6885-SAN, CE8850-SAN, CE8855, CE8851-32CQ4BQ, CE8851K, CE8851-32CQ8DQ-P, CE8850-HAM, CE6881H, CE6881H-K, CE6820H, CE6820H-K, CE6820S, CE6885, CE6885-T, CE6885-LL (standard forwarding mode) and CE6863E-48S8CQ.



Format
------

**peer** *group-name* **keychain** *keychain-name*

**undo peer** *group-name* **keychain**


Parameters
----------

| Parameter | Description | Value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| *group-name* | Specifies the name of a peer group. | The name is a string of 1 to 47 case-sensitive characters, with spaces not supported. When double quotation marks are used around the string, spaces are allowed in the string. |
| *keychain-name* | Specifies the name of the keychain.  Before configuring keychain authentication, run the keychain command to create a keychain, the key-id command to configure a key ID, the key-string command to configure a password, and the algorithm command to configure an algorithm for the keychain. If these commands are not run, the keychain authentication fails, and the peer relationship cannot be established.  If the dependent keychain is deleted, the peer relationship may be interrupted. Therefore, exercise caution when deleting the keychain. | The value is a string of 1 to 47 case-insensitive characters. The characters do not include question marks (?) or spaces. However, when double quotation marks (") are used around the string, spaces are allowed in the string. |

Usage Guidelines
----------------

**Usage Scenario**

Configuring Keychain authentication improves the security of the TCP connection. You must configure Keychain authentication specified for TCP-based applications on both BGP peers. Note that encryption algorithms and passwords configured for the Keychain authentication on both peers must be the same; otherwise, the TCP connection cannot be set up between BGP peers and BGP messages cannot be transmitted.

**Prerequisites**

Before configuring the BGP Keychain authentication, a Keychain in accordance with the configured keychain-name must be configured first.

**Precautions**

The peer keychain command and the peer password command are mutually exclusive.


Example
-------

# Configure keychain authentication named keychain\_1 for a peer group.
