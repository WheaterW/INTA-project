Parameters
----------

| Parameter | Description | Value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| *groupAddr* | Specifies the IPv6 address of a multicast group. | - |

| **rpf-interface** *iif-port-type* *iif-port-num* | Displays multicast routing entries of a specified Reverse Path Forwarding (RPF) interface. | - |
| *iif-port-name* | Displays the PIM routing entries with specified upstream interfaces. | - |
| **outgoing-interface** *oif-port-type* *oif-port-num* | Displays the PIM routing entries with specified downstream interfaces. | The value of outgoing-interface parameter is:   * include * exclude * match |
| **include** | Displays the (S, G) routing entries with a specified downstream interface included. | If this keyword is set, the type and number of an interface must be specified. |
| **exclude** | Displays the (S, G) routing entries with a specified downstream interface excluded. | If this keyword is set, the type and number of an interface must be specified. |
| **match** | Displays the (S, G) routing entries with the downstream interfaces being a specified interface. | If the type and number of the interface is not specified, the (S, G) routing entries with no downstream interfaces are displayed. |
| *oif-port-name* | Displays the PIM routing entries with specified downstream interfaces. | - |
| **none** | Displays the PIM routing entries with no downstream interfaces. | - |
| **flags** | Indicates the type of a routing entry. | The type flag of entries can be the following values:   * wc * act * niif * fsm |
| **wc** | Indicates the routing entry with the wc flag. | - |
| **act** | Multicast routing entry that has received actual data. | - |
| **niif** | Routing entry whose inbound interface is not determined. | - |
| **fsm** | Indicates the details of FSM states. | - |
| **outgoing-interface-number** *oif-number* | Displays the IPv6 PIM routing entries with a specified number of downstream interfaces. | - |

Usage Guidelines
----------------

The **display pim ipv6 routing-table** command is used to display the contents of an IPv6 PIM routing table, including the source addresses and group addresses, Rendezvous Points (RPs), and upstream interface and downstream interface lists of the (S, G) and (\*, G) entries.If the mode bidir parameter is specified, the **display pim ipv6 routing-table** command displays only multicast routing entries generated by IPv6 BIDIR-PIM.
