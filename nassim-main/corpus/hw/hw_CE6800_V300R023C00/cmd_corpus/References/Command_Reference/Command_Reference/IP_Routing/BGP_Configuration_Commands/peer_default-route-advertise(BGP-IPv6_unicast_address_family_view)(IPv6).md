========================================================================

peer default-route-advertise(BGP-IPv6 unicast address family view)(IPv6)

Function
--------



The **peer default-route-advertise** command configures a device to advertise default routes to its peer.

The **undo peer default-route-advertise** command restores the default configuration.



By default, a BGP device does not advertise any default route to its peer.

Parameters
----------

| Parameter | Description | Value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| *peerIpv6Addr* | Specifies the IPv6 address of a peer. | The value is a 32-digit hexadecimal number, in the format of X:X:X:X:X:X:X:X. |
| **route-policy** *route-policy-name* | Specifies the name of a routing policy. | The value is a string of 1 to 200 case-sensitive characters without spaces. The character string can contain spaces if it is enclosed with double quotation marks ("). |
| **conditional-route-match-all** | Configures the device to send the default route when all conditional routes are matched. | - |
| **conditional-route-match-any** | Configures the device to send the default route when any conditional route is matched. | - |
| *ipv6-address* | Specifies the IPv6 address of a conditional route. | The value is in the format of X:X:X:X:X:X:X:X. |
| *ipv6-mask-length* | Specifies the mask length of the conditional routes. | It is an integer ranging from 0 to 128. |

Usage Guidelines
----------------

**Usage Scenario**

Default routes are usually used on networks with the following characteristics:

* There are multiple EBGP peers, and full Internet routes are received from each peer.
* There are multiple RRs, and each RR receives full Internet routes.If load balancing is not performed on a network, a BGP peer receives at most one copy of active full Internet routes. If load balancing is performed on a network, the number of active routes received by a BGP peer increases sharply, causing the number of routes on the network to sharply increase.On such a network, you can configure the device to advertise default routes to BGP peers and use default routes for load balancing to reduce the number of routes on the network.This command does not require that a default route exist in the routing table. Instead, the device unconditionally sends a default route with the next hop being itself to the peer.

**Precautions**

This command enables the device to advertise the default route generated by itself, and condition-based matching is not used. Therefore, you are not advised to configure if-match clauses in a route-policy.


Example
-------

# Configure a BGP device to advertise default routes to its peer.
```
<HUAWEI> system-view
[~HUAWEI] bgp 100
[*HUAWEI-bgp] peer 2001:DB8:1::1 as-number 200
[*HUAWEI-bgp] ipv6-family unicast
[*HUAWEI-bgp-af-ipv6] peer 2001:DB8:1::1 enable
[*HUAWEI-bgp-af-ipv6] peer 2001:DB8:1::1 default-route-advertise

```
