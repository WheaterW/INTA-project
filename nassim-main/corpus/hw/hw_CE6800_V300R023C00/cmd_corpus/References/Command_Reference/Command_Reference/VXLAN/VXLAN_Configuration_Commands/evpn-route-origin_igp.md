Usage Guidelines
----------------

According to BGP, the origin attribute carried by a route indicates the origin of the route, which can be IGP, EGP, or incomplete. The command can be used to control whether the origin attribute carried by the routes (including Type 1, Type 2, Type 3, and Type 4 routes) generated by EVPN is igp or incomplete. By default, this function is enabled, that is, the origin attribute is igp.After the upgrade, the **undo evpn-route-origin igp** command is added to keep the origin attribute of generated routes as imcomplete.
