The **safe-sync enable** command enables secure synchronization.

The **undo safe-sync enable** command disables secure synchronization.



By default, secure synchronization is not enabled.

**undo safe-sync enable**


Parameters
----------

None

Views
-----

OSPF view


Default Level
-------------

2: Configuration level


Usage Guidelines
----------------

In OSPF-BGP association, the router LSA originated on a device in the stub-router state is discarded after the device is restarted. Due to the limit on the LSA retransmission interval, its neighbor still uses the previous router LSA to calculate the route that passes through the device. As a result, temporary packet loss occurs before the device establishes the neighbor relationship with the peer end.After secure synchronization is configured on a device to be restarted, when the device synchronizes the LSDB with the peer end, it deletes or updates the LSA that is received from the peer end if the LSA was generated by itself. Then, the neighbor state machines of the restarted device and its peer end can reach the Full state, and the neighbor relationship between them can be established.


Example
-------

# Enable secure synchronization in OSPF process 100.
```
<HUAWEI> system-view
[~HUAWEI] ospf 100
[*HUAWEI-ospf-100] safe-sync enable

```
