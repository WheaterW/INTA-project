Function
--------



The **ipv6 frr** command enables IPv6 Fast Reroute (FRR) of a private network in the VPN instance IPv6 address family view.

Usage Guidelines
----------------

**Usage Scenario**

When there are private network routes generated by multiple types of routing protocols in a VPN instance enabled with the IPv6 address family, the **ipv6 frr** command can be used to enable IPv6 FRR to immediately switch traffic among routes and ensure uninterrupted traffic forwarding if certain routes are faulty.

**Prerequisites**

The VPN instance has been created, and the IPv6 address family has been enabled in the VPN instance.

**Configuration Impact**

After the **ipv6 frr** command is run, the system automatically selects an inactive route as the backup of an active route.

**Precautions**

A routing loop may occur after the **ipv6 frr** command is run because the command is used to enable routes generated by different routing protocols to back up each other. Therefore, exercise caution when running the command.


Example
-------

# Enable IPv6 FRR of a private network in a VPN instance.
```
<HUAWEI> system-view
[~HUAWEI] ip vpn-instance vpn1
[*HUAWEI-vpn-instance-vpn1] ipv6-family unicast
[*HUAWEI-vpn-instance-vpn1-af-ipv6] ipv6 frr

```
