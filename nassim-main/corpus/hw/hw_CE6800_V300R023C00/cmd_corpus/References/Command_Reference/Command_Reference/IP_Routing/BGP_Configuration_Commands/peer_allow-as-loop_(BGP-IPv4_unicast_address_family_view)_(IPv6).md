peer allow-as-loop (BGP-IPv4 unicast address family view) (IPv6)
================================================================

peer allow-as-loop (BGP-IPv4 unicast address family view) (IPv6)

Function
--------



The **peer allow-as-loop** command sets the number of local AS number repetitions.

The **undo peer allow-as-loop** command cancels the configuration.



By default, the local AS number cannot be repeated.

**undo peer** *peerIpv6Addr* **allow-as-loop**


Parameters
----------

| Parameter | Description | Value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| *peerIpv6Addr* | Specifies the IPv6 address of a BGP peer. | The value is a 32-digit hexadecimal number, in the format of X:X:X:X:X:X:X:X. |
| *num* | Specifies the number of local AS number repetitions. | The value is an integer ranging from 1 to 10. The default value is 1. |

Usage Guidelines
----------------

**Usage Scenario**

BGP uses AS numbers to detect routing loops. The AS numbers in the AS\_Path of each received route are matched against the local AS number configured using the bgp command and the fake AS number configured using the peer fake-as command. The largest number of times any of the configured AS numbers is repeated is considered as the maximum number. In the Hub and Spoke networking, if EBGP runs between a Hub-PE and a Hub-CE on a Hub site, the route sent from the Hub-PE to the Hub-CE carries the AS number of the Hub-PE. If the Hub-CE sends a routing update to the Hub-PE, the Hub-PE will deny it because the routing update contains the AS number of the Hub-PE.To ensure proper route transmission in the Hub and Spoke networking, configure all the BGP peers on the path, along which the Hub-CE advertises private network routes to the Spoke-CE, to accept the routes in which the AS number repeats once.

**Prerequisites**

Peer relationships have been established using the **peer as-number** command.

**Configuration Impact**

If this command is run for a peer multiple times, the latest configuration overrides the previous one.

**Precautions**

The **peer allow-as-loop** command does not take effect for IBGP peers or BGP peers in a sub-confederation. The device checks whether the routes received from EBGP peers or EBGP peers in the confederation contain the local AS number. The minimum number of repetitions is 2, and the value 1 is not displayed.Running the **peer allow-as-loop** command may cause routing loops. Therefore, exercise caution when running this command and specify the number of AS number repetitions as required.


Example
-------

# Set the number of local AS number repetitions to 2.
```
<HUAWEI> system-view
[~HUAWEI] bgp 100
[*HUAWEI-bgp] peer FE80::1 as-number 100
[*HUAWEI-bgp] ipv4-family unicast
[*HUAWEI-bgp-af-ipv4] peer FE80::1 enable
[*HUAWEI-bgp-af-ipv4] peer FE80::1 allow-as-loop 2

```
