**Table 1** Description of the **display mrt ipv6 routing-table** command output
| Item | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Route Flags | Route flag:  R: indicates that the route recurses to another route or tunnel.  D: indicates that the route is delivered to the FIB. |
| MRT Routing Tables | The routing table is a VPN routing table. |
| Destinations | Total number of destination networks/hosts. |
| Routes | Total number of routes. |
| Destination | Destination network. |
| PrefixLength | Prefix length. |
| NextHop | Next hop address. |
| Preference | Route preference. |
| Neighbour | Neighbor. |
| ProcessID | Process ID of the routing protocol. |
| Label | Label allocated by MPLS. |
| Protocol | Routing protocol. |
| State | Route status:   * Active: active route. * Invalid: invalid route. * Inactive: inactive route. * NoAdv: routes that cannot be advertised. * Adv: routes that can be advertised. * Del: route to be deleted. * GotQ: route that is successfully recursed. * WaitQ: route that has not been recursed successfully. * Stale: route with the Stale flag, which is used in GR. * Relied: route that is recursed to the next hop and outbound interface, or the route that is recursed to a tunnel. |
| Cost | Route cost. |
| Entry ID | Keyword for searching for a route in the routing table. |
