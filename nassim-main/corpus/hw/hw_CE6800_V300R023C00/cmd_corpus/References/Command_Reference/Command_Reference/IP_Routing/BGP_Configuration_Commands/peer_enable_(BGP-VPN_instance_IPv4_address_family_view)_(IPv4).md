peer enable (BGP-VPN instance IPv4 address family view) (IPv4)
==============================================================

peer enable (BGP-VPN instance IPv4 address family view) (IPv4)

Function
--------



The **peer enable** command enables a BGP device to exchange routes with a specified peer group in the address family view.

The **undo peer enable** command disables a BGP device from exchanging routes with a specified peer group.



By default, a device is disabled from exchanging routing information with a specified peer.


Format
------

**peer** *ipv4-address* **enable**

**undo peer** *ipv4-address* **enable**


Parameters
----------

| Parameter | Description | Value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| *ipv4-address* | Specifies an IPv4 peer address. | The value is in dotted decimal notation. |

Usage Guidelines
----------------

**Usage Scenario**

By default, only peer groups in the BGP-IPv4 unicast address family are automatically enabled to exchange routing information. In other words, after the **peer as-number** command is run in the BGP view, the system automatically configures the **peer enable** command. In other address family views, however, this function must be manually enabled.

**Configuration Impact**

Enabling or disabling a BGP peer in this address family causes the BGP connection with the peer in another address family to be disconnected and automatically renegotiated.


Example
-------

# Enable the device to exchange routing information with a specified peer in the address family view.
```
<HUAWEI> system-view
[~HUAWEI] ip vpn-instance vpna
[*HUAWEI-vpn-instance-vpna] ipv4-family
[*HUAWEI-vpn-instance-vpna-af-ipv4] route-distinguisher 100:1
[*HUAWEI-vpn-instance-vpna-af-ipv4] quit
[*HUAWEI-vpn-instance-vpna] quit
[*HUAWEI] bgp 100
[*HUAWEI-bgp] vpn-instance vpna
[*HUAWEI-bgp-instance-vpna] peer 10.1.1.1 as-number 100
[*HUAWEI-bgp-instance-vpna] quit
[*HUAWEI-bgp] ipv4-family vpn-instance vpna
[*HUAWEI-bgp-vpna] peer 10.1.1.1 enable
