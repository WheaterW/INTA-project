peer capability-advertise (BGP multi-instance VPN instance IPv4 address family view) (group)

Function
--------



The **peer capability-advertise** command enables the optional functions for BGP to advertise routes, including the route-refresh function, conventional functions, and 4-byte AS number function.

The **undo peer capability-advertise** command restores the default setting.



By default, the BGP route-refresh and 4-byte AS number functions are enabled, but conventional functions are disabled.

Usage Guidelines
----------------

**Usage Scenario**



BGP has many optional functions when advertising routes, including the route-refresh function, conventional functions, and 4-byte AS number function. Using the **peer capability-advertise** command, you can enable or disable these functions as required.



**Precautions**



Enabling or disabling the route-refresh function, conventional function, or 4-byte AS number function causes the peer session to be disconnected and then re-established, leading to a temporary network interruption. Therefore, exercise caution when performing this operation.




Example
-------

# Configure a BGP device to advertise the route-refresh capability to its peer.
```
<HUAWEI> system-view

[*HUAWEI-vpn-instance-vpna-af-ipv4] route-distinguisher 100:1
[*HUAWEI-vpn-instance-vpna-af-ipv4] vpn-target 111:1 both
[*HUAWEI-vpn-instance-vpna-af-ipv4] quit
[*HUAWEI-instance-vpna] quit
[*HUAWEI] bgp 100 instance a
[*HUAWEI-bgp-instance-a] ipv4-family vpn-instance vpna
[*HUAWEI-bgp-instance-a-vpna] group test
