=============================

display vlan instance mapping

Function

The **display vlan instance mapping** command displays mappings between Multiple Spanning Tree instances (MSTIs) and VLANs.




Format

**display vlan instance mapping**


Parameters
----------

None

Views

All views


Default Level
-------------

1: Monitoring level


Usage Guidelines
----------------

**Usage Scenario**



After you configure mappings between MSTIs and VLANs, run the display vlan instance mapping command to view the mappings between MSTIs and VLANs.



**Prerequisites**

The mappings between MSTIs and VLANs have been configured using either of the following methods:

* Configure mappings between MSTIs and VLANs in the MST region view.

1. Run the **system-view** command to enter the system view.
2. Run the **stp region-configuration** command to enter the MST region view.
3. Run the instance instance-id vlan { vlan-id [ to vlan-id ] } & <1-10> command to map VLANs to an MSTI. By default, all VLANs in an MST region are mapped to MSTI 0. A VLAN cannot be mapped to multiple MSTIs. If you map a VLAN that is already mapped to an MSTI to another MSTI, the original mapping is deleted.

* Configure mappings between MSTIs and VLANs in the VLAN instance view.

1. Run the **system-view** command to enter the system view.
2. Run the **vlan instance** command to enter the VLAN instance view.
3. Run the instance instance-id vlan { vlan-id [ to vlan-id ] } & <1-10> command to map VLANs to an MSTI.
