prefix limit (VPN instance IPv6 address family view)
====================================================

prefix limit (VPN instance IPv6 address family view)

Function
--------



The **prefix limit** command sets the maximum number of route prefixes allowed for a VPN instance IPv6 address family, preventing a PE from importing excessive VPN routes.

The **undo prefix limit** command restores the default setting.



By default, the maximum number of route prefixes allowed for a VPN instance IPv6 address family is not limited.

This command is supported only on the CE6863H, CE6863H-K, CE6860-SAN, CE6866K, CE6866, CE6860-HAM, CE6855-48XS8CQ, CE6885-SAN, CE8850-SAN, CE8855, CE8851-32CQ4BQ, CE8851K, CE8851-32CQ8DQ-P, CE8850-HAM, CE6881H, CE6881H-K, CE6820H, CE6820H-K, CE6820S, CE6885, CE6885-T, CE6885-LL (standard forwarding mode) and CE6863E-48S8CQ.



Format
------

**prefix limit** *number* { *alert-percent* [ **route-unchanged** ] | **simply-alert** }

**undo prefix limit**


Parameters
----------

| Parameter | Description | Value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| *number* | Specifies the maximum number of route prefixes allowed for a VPN instance IPv6 address family. | The value is an integer ranging from 1 to 4294967295. |
| *alert-percent* | Specifies the proportion of the alarm threshold to the maximum number of route prefixes allowed for a VPN instance IPv6 address family. When the number of route prefixes in a VPN instance IPv6 address family exceeds number x alert-percent/100, the system generates an alarm. In this case, additional VPN routes can still be added to the routing table of the VPN instance IPv6 address family until the number of route prefixes of the VPN instance IPv6 address family reaches number. | The value is an integer ranging from 1 to 100. |
| **route-unchanged** | Indicates that the routing table remains unchanged. By default, route-unchanged is not configured. When the number of route prefixes in the routing table exceeds number, routes are processed as follows:   * If route-unchanged is configured, routes in the routing table remain unchanged. * If route-unchanged is not configured, all routes in the routing table are deleted and then re-added. | - |
| **simply-alert** | Indicates that when the number of VPN route prefixes exceeds number, VPN routes can still be added to the routing table of the VPN instance IPv6 address family, but the system will generate an alarm. | - |

Usage Guidelines

**Usage Scenario**

If many useless route prefixes imported into a VPN instance constitute a large proportion of route prefixes on a device, run this command to set a limit on the maximum number of prefixes supported by the VPN instance.It is recommended that you run this command together with the **peer route-limit** command in the BGP-VPN instance IPv6 address family view. The VPNv6 routes received from the remote PE are first saved in the local VPNv6 routing table indexed by the RD, and then imported into the routing table of the corresponding VPN instance IPv6 address family based on the VPN target matching relationship. The **prefix limit** command can prevent excessive route prefixes from being added to the routing table of the VPN instance IPv6 address family, but cannot prevent a PE from receiving excessive routes from other PEs. As a result, excessive VPNv6 routing table space is consumed.The static and direct routes configured on the PE are not affected by the **prefix limit** command. That is, after the number of routes exceeds the limit, static and direct routes can still be added to the IPv6 routing table of the VPN instance.

**Precautions**

If the number of route prefixes exceeds the set limit and the **undo prefix limit** command is run, the system will receive the route prefixes from routing tables generated by protocols to create a private network routing table.


Example
-------

# Set the allowed maximum number of route prefixes allowed for a VPN instance IPv6 address family to 1000.
```
<HUAWEI> system-view
[~HUAWEI] ip vpn-instance vpn1
[*HUAWEI-vpn-instance-vpn1] ipv6-family
[*HUAWEI-vpn-instance-vpn1-af-ipv6] route-distinguisher 100:1
[*HUAWEI-vpn-instance-vpn1-af-ipv6] prefix limit 1000 simply-alert
