===========================================================

peer tracking disable(BGP multi-instance VPN instance view)

Function
--------



The **peer tracking** command enables BGP peer tracking. After BGP peer tracking is enabled, BGP can rapidly detect the unreachability of a peer and re-establish a connection with the peer.

The **undo peer tracking** command disables BGP peer tracking.



By default, BGP Peer Tracking is disabled.

Parameters
----------

| Parameter | Description | Value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| *peerIpv4Addr* | Specifies the IPv4 address of a peer. | The value is in dotted decimal notation. |
| **delay** *delay-val* | Indicates the interval between when BGP detects the peer unreachable and when BGP tears down the corresponding connection. | The value is an integer that ranges from 0 to 65535, in seconds. The default value is 0 seconds. |
| *peerIpv6Addr* | Specifies the IPv6 address of a peer.  NOTE:  This parameter is supported only on the CE6863H, CE6863H-K, CE6860-SAN, CE6866K, CE6866, CE6860-HAM, CE6855-48XS8CQ, CE6885-SAN, CE8850-SAN, CE8855, CE8851-32CQ4BQ, CE8851K, CE8851-32CQ8DQ-P, CE8850-HAM, CE6881H, CE6881H-K, CE6820H, CE6820H-K, CE6820S, CE6885, CE6885-T, CE6885-LL (standard forwarding mode) and CE6863E-48S8CQ. | The value is a 32-digit hexadecimal number, in the format of X:X:X:X:X:X:X:X. |

Usage Guidelines
----------------

In a network where BFD is unsuitable to be deployed, you can configure BGP Peer Tracking on the local device to implement fast network convergence by rapidly detecting the unreachable state of the peer.A BGP peer is considered unreachable in either of the following situations:

* The BGP peer's IP address does not match any route in the IP routing table.
* The BGP peer's IP address matches a route with the outbound interface being a Null0 interface in the IP routing table.A proper value of delay-time can ensure network stability when a peer is detected unreachable.
* If delay-time is set to 0, BGP immediately tears down the connection between the local device and its peer after the peer is detected unreachable.
* If IGP route flapping occurs and delay-time for an IBGP peer is set to 0, the peer relationship between the local device and the peer alternates between Up and Down. Therefore, delay-time for an IBGP peer should be set to a value greater than the actual IGP route convergence time.
* When BGP neighbors successfully perform the GR negotiation, the master/slave switchover occurs on the BGP neighbors, to prevent the failure of GR, delay-time should be set to a value greater than GR convergence time. If delay-time is set to be smaller than the GR convergence time, the connection between the local device and the BGP peer will be torn down, which leads to the failure of GR.
