Usage Guidelines
----------------

**Usage Scenario**

In scenarios where servers are partitioned into multiple VMs, to allow flexible deployment and migration of VMs on multiple servers or devices, the common solution is to configure Layer 2 interconnection between multiple devices. However, this approach may lead to larger Layer 2 domains on the network and the risk of broadcast storms. To resolve this problem, the common method is to configure a VM gateway on an access device and enable proxy ARP anyway on the gateway so that the gateway sends its own MAC address to a source VM and communication between VMs is implemented through route forwarding. To enable proxy ARP anyway on an interface, run the **arp proxy anyway enable** command.

**Precautions**



On an interface for which proxy ARP anyway is configured, you need to run the **arp direct-route enable** command to advertise host routes generated based on ARP entries.Proxy ARP anyway is not supported in the following situations:The arp l2-proxy enable command has been run in the BD view of the VBDIF interface on which proxy ARP anyway needs to be configured.The **arp broadcast-suppress enable** command has been run in the BD view of the VBDIF interface on which proxy ARP anyway needs to be configured.The **arp collect host enable** command has been run on the VBDIF interface on which proxy ARP anyway needs to be configured.




Example
-------

# Enable proxy ARP anyway on VLANIF 100.
```
<HUAWEI> system-view
[~HUAWEI] interface vlanif 100
[*HUAWEI-Vlanif100] arp proxy anyway enable

```
