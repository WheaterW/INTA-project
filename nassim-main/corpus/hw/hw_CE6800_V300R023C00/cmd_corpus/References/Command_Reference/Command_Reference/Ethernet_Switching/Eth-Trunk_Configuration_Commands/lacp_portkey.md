lacp portkey

Function
--------



The **lacp portkey** command sets a portkey value for member interfaces of an Eth-Trunk interface in static LACP mode.

The **undo lacp portkey** command restores the function of automatically generating a portkey value for member interfaces of an Eth-Trunk interface in static LACP mode.

Usage Guidelines

**Usage Scenario**



When a non-Huawei device is dual-homed to Huawei devices functioning as PEs, if the non-Huawei device does not support E-Trunk interconnection, you need to manually configure the same system ID, system priority, and port key for the two PEs to ensure that the links of the two PEs can be selected.




Example
-------

# Set the portkey value of Eth-Trunk 10 in static LACP mode to 123.
```
<HUAWEI> system-view
[~HUAWEI] interface eth-trunk 10
[*HUAWEI-Eth-Trunk10] mode lacp-static
[*HUAWEI-Eth-Trunk10] lacp portkey 123

```
