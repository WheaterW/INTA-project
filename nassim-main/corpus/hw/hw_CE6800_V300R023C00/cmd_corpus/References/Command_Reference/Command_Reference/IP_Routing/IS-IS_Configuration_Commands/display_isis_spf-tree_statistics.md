Parameters
----------

| Parameter | Description | Value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| *process-id* | Displays the SPT topology of a specified IS-IS process. | The value is an integer ranging from 1 to 4294967295. |
| **statistics** | Displays the statistics of the SPT, including information about links and nodes in the SPT and the status of the SPF calculation. | - |
| **level-1** | Displays the SPT topology of Level-1. | - |
| **level-2** | Displays the SPT topology of Level-2. | - |
| **ipv6** | Displays the SPT topology of IPv6.  NOTE:  This parameter is supported only on the CE6863H, CE6863H-K, CE6860-SAN, CE6866K, CE6866, CE6860-HAM, CE6855-48XS8CQ, CE6885-SAN, CE8850-SAN, CE8855, CE8851-32CQ4BQ, CE8851K, CE8851-32CQ8DQ-P, CE8850-HAM, CE6881H, CE6881H-K, CE6820H, CE6820H-K, CE6820S, CE6885, CE6885-T, CE6885-LL (standard forwarding mode) and CE6863E-48S8CQ. | - |
| **vpn-instance** *vpn-instance-name* | Displays mesh-group information about a specified VPN instance. | The value is a string of 1 to 31 case-sensitive characters. It cannot contain spaces. The VPN instance name cannot be \_public\_. If the character string is quoted by double quotation marks, the character string can contain spaces. |

Usage Guidelines
----------------

When an error occurs in the route calculation, run the **display isis spf-tree** command to check whether the IS-IS topology information is correct.You can specify statistics to view the status of the SPT. The generated SPT can be used to calculate routes only when the SPF calculation status is Completed (the ISPF calculation is complete).
