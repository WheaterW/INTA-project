**Table 1** Description of the **display configuration commit list** command output
| Item | Description |
| --- | --- |
| CommitId | ID of the configuration rollback point. |
| Label | Label of the configuration rollback point, which uniquely identifies the configuration rollback point. |
| User | User name. |
| TimeStamp | Timestamp of the configuration rollback point. |
| Description | Remarks about a configuration rollback point. You can run the commit label <labelstring> [ description <descriptionstring> ] command to add description for a configuration rollback point. |
| User-Intf | Path type, such as CON1 and VTY1. |
| Type | Terminal type, for example, CLI, SNMP, NETCONF, ROLLBACK, RESTORE, or SYSTEM.   * CLI: configuration rollback point generated based on the command manually configured by the administrator. * SNMP: configuration rollback point generated based on the configurations delivered by the NMS. * NETCONF: configuration rollback point generated based on the configurations delivered by the controller. * ROLLBACK: configuration rollback point generated after the rollback configuration command is run. For example, if a user performs four configuration operations and commits them, four consecutive configuration rollback points a, b, c, and d are generated. If the user finds that the configuration at point b is incorrect and rolls back the configuration to point a, configuration rollback point E is generated and is marked with a Rollback flag, indicating that this point is generated because of configuration rollback. * RESTORE: rollback point that is automatically generated when the device is restarted. This configuration at this point is the one after the device is restarted. * SYSTEM: configuration rollback point that is automatically generated by the system when the undo configuration checkpoint auto-save disable command is run to enable the function of automatically saving rollback points. |
