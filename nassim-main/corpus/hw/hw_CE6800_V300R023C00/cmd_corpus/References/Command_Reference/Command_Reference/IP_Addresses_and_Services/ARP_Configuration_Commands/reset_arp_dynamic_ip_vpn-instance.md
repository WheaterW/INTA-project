Usage Guidelines
----------------

**Usage Scenario**



If an unauthorized user sends a large number of ARP messages to a device, the device learns a large number of ARP entries in a short period of time, causing a buffer overflow. As a result, users may fail to access the network. To resolve the problem, run the **reset arp** command to delete invalid ARP entries so that new ARP entries can be created to allow authorized user access.



**Prerequisites**



ARP entries exist on a device.The VPN instance specified by vpn-instance vpn-instance-name exists if this parameter is configured.



**Configuration Impact**



After an ARP entry is cleared, the mapping between the IP and MAC addresses in the entry is cleared. As a result, users may fail to access the network, and services may be interrupted.
