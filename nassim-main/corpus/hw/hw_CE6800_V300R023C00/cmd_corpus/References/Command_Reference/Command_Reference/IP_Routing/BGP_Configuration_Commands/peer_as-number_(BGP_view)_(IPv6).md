peer as-number (BGP view) (IPv6)
================================

peer as-number (BGP view) (IPv6)

Function
--------



The **peer as-number** command creates a peer and configures an AS number for the peer.

The **undo peer** command deletes a specified peer.



By default, no BGP peer is configured, and no AS number is specified for a peer or peer group.

This command is supported only on the CE6863H, CE6863H-K, CE6860-SAN, CE6866K, CE6866, CE6860-HAM, CE6855-48XS8CQ, CE6885-SAN, CE8850-SAN, CE8855, CE8851-32CQ4BQ, CE8851K, CE8851-32CQ8DQ-P, CE8850-HAM, CE6881H, CE6881H-K, CE6820H, CE6820H-K, CE6820S, CE6885, CE6885-T, CE6885-LL (standard forwarding mode) and CE6863E-48S8CQ.



Format

**peer** *ipv6-address* **as-number** *as-number*

**undo peer** *ipv6-address*


Parameters
----------

| Parameter | Description | Value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| *ipv6-address* | Specifies the IPv6 address of a peer. | The value is a 32-digit hexadecimal number, in the format of X:X:X:X:X:X:X:X. |
| *as-number* | Specifies a destination AS number. | For an AS number in integer format, the value ranges from 1 to 4294967295.  For an AS number in dotted notation, it is in the format of x.y, in which x and y are integers, with x ranging from 1 to 65535 and y ranging from 0 to 65535. |

Usage Guidelines
----------------

**Usage Scenario**

You can run the **peer as-number** command to create a specified peer relationship and specify the AS number of the peer.

**Precautions**

If the peer group to which a peer belongs is not configured with an AS number or the peer is not added to any peer group, deleting the AS number of the peer resets the peer relationship.Running the **undo peer** *ipv4-address*or **undo peer** *ipv6-address*command deletes configurations related to the peer in all address families. Therefore, exercise caution when running this command.When the local device sends routes to IBGP peers, the AS\_Path attribute does not carry the local AS number. When the local device sends routes to EBGP peers, the AS\_Path attribute carries the local AS number.It is recommended that the hold time be set based on the total number of BGP peers in each address family. As the number of peers increases, the recommended minimum hold time increases accordingly. Adjust the hold time according to "Mapping Between the Total Number of BGP Peers in Each Address Family and the Recommended Minimum Hold Time" in the usage guide of the **peer timer** command.


Example
-------

# Set the AS number to 100 for IPv6 peer 2001:DB8:1::1.
```
<HUAWEI> system-view
[~HUAWEI] bgp 100
[*HUAWEI-bgp] peer 2001:DB8:1::1 as-number 100

```
