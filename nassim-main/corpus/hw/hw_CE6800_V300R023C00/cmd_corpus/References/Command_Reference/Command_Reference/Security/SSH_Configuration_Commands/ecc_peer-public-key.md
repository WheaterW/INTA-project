Usage Guidelines
----------------

**Usage Scenario**

When you use an ECC public key for authentication, specify the public key on the server for the client of SSH users. When the client logs in to the server, the server uses the specified public key to authenticate the client.After you enter the ECC public key view, run the **public-key-code begin** command, and copy the ECC public key to the server.

**Follow-up Procedure**

After you copy the ECC public key generated on the client to the server, perform the following operations to exit the ECC public key view:

1. Run the **public-key-code end** command to return to the ECC public key view.
2. Run the **peer-public-key end** command to exit the ECC public key view and return to the system view.

**Precautions**

The public key on the client is randomly generated by the client software.If an ECC public key has been assigned to an SSH user, run the **undo ssh user user-name assign ecc-key** command to delete the mapping between the ECC public key and the SSH user. If you do not delete the mapping, the **undo ecc peer-public-key** command cannot delete the ECC public key.A maximum of 20 ECC public keys can be configured.
