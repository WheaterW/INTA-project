ipv6 default-route-advertise
============================

ipv6 default-route-advertise

Function
--------



The **ipv6 default-route-advertise** command enables a device to advertise a default IPv6 route.

The **undo ipv6 default-route-advertise** command disables a device from advertising a default IPv6 route.



By default, a device does not advertise default IPv6 routes.

Format
------

**ipv6 default-route-advertise** [ **always** | **match** **default** | { **route-policy** *route-policy-name* } ] [ [ **cost** *cost* ] | [ **tag** *tag* ] | [ **level-1** | **level-2** | **level-1-2** ] ] \* [ **avoid-learning** ]

**undo ipv6 default-route-advertise**


Parameters
----------

| Parameter | Description | Value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **always** | Enables an IS-IS device to advertise the default IPv6 route unconditionally. This parameter is specified by default when the ipv6 default-route-advertise command is run. In this case, if the avoid-learning parameter is not specified, the device is allowed to calculate the IS-IS default IPv6 routes advertised by other devices, which may cause routing loops. | - |
| **match** | Advertises a default route in the local LSP when the default route generated by another routing protocol or another IS-IS process exists in the IPv6 routing table. | - |
| **default** | Configures the device to advertises the default routes in local LSPs if it has active default IPv6 routes of other routing protocols or IS-IS processes. The priority of the matched default route must be higher than that of the routes in the IS-IS process on the local device. Otherwise, the IS-IS process on the local device changes the default route on which the IS-IS process depends to inactive after calculating the received default route. | - |
| **route-policy** *route-policy-name* | Specifies the name of a route-policy.   * If the routes that match the route-policy include non-default routes, a default IPv6 route that belongs to a process of another routing protocol, or a default IPv6 route that belongs to another IS-IS process, the device advertises a default route through a local LSP. In this case, if the avoid-learning parameter is not specified, the device is allowed to calculate the IS-IS default routes advertised by other devices, which may cause routing loops. * If only the default IPv6 route in the current local IS-IS process matches the route-policy, the device does not advertise a default route through a local LSP. | The value is a string of 1 to 200 case-sensitive characters without spaces. The character string can contain spaces if it is enclosed with double quotation marks ("). |
| **cost** *cost* | Specifies a cost for the default route. | The value is an integer ranging from 0 to 4261412864. |
| **tag** *tag* | Specifies a tag for the default route to be advertised. | The value is an integer ranging from 1 to 4294967295. |
| **level-1** | Sets the level as Level-1. | - |
| **level-2** | Sets the level as Level-2. | - |
| **level-1-2** | Sets the level as Level-1-2.  If you do not specify a level, Level-2 routes are generated by default. | - |
| **avoid-learning** | Prevents the specified IS-IS process from adding a learned default IPv6 route to the routing table.   * If the local device has advertised a default route in the specified IS-IS process, the device no longer adds a learned IS-IS default route to the routing table. * If the device has not advertised a default route in the specified IS-IS process, the device can still add a learned IS-IS default route to the routing table even if avoid-learning is specified. | - |

Usage Guidelines
----------------

**Usage Scenario**

This command can be run on a Level-1 or Level-2 device.By using a route-policy, you can configure IS-IS to generate default routes only when there is a matched entry in the routing table.

* If the **apply isis level-1** command is used in the route-policy view, IS-IS can generate default routes in Level-1 LSPs.
* If the **apply isis level-2** command is used in the route-policy view, IS-IS can generate default routes in Level-2 LSPs.
* If the **apply isis level-1-2** command is used in the route-policy view, IS-IS can generate default routes in Level-1 and Level-2 LSPs.

**Prerequisites**

The ipv6 default-route-advertise command takes effect only after IPv6 is enabled for the IS-IS process. For details, see isis ipv6 enable.

**Configuration Impact**

After the **undo ipv6 default-route advertise** command is run, the default route generated by an IS-IS device is deleted, which may interrupt services on the device.

**Precautions**

If always is specified, default routes are advertised unconditionally. In some fault scenarios, route blackholes may occur when the route source is unreachable. Therefore, you are advised to select always or match default based on the networking plan.

* If the default-route-advertise command is run on a Level-1 device, the device advertises default routes only to the Level-1 area and does not advertise default routes to the Level-2 area.
* If always is configured, traffic is forwarded to the local device after the uplink fails. To prevent this problem, configure the match default mode.
* If match default is specified, the priority of the dependent default route is higher than that of the IS-IS route. Otherwise, the default route may fail to be advertised or a loop may occur.

Example
-------

# Configure the device to generate the default IPv6 routes in Level-1-2 LSPs.
```
<HUAWEI> system-view
[~HUAWEI] isis 1
[*HUAWEI-isis-1] ipv6 enable
[*HUAWEI-isis-1] ipv6 default-route-advertise
