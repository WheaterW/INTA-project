Usage Guidelines
----------------

**Usage Scenario**

The **peer advertise-community** command is used to configure a device to advertise a community attribute to its peer. If a device advertises a community attribute to its peer group, all the members of the peer group will inherit the configuration. This simplifies the application of routing policies and facilitates route maintenance and management.

**Precautions**

Before running the **peer advertise-community** command to advertise BGP community attributes, you can use a routing policy to define specific community attributes.


Example
-------

# Configure a device to advertise a community attribute to its peer.
```
<HUAWEI> system-view
[~HUAWEI] bgp 100
[*HUAWEI-bgp] peer FE80::1 as-number 100
[*HUAWEI-bgp] ipv4-family unicast
[*HUAWEI-bgp-af-ipv4] peer FE80::1 enable
[*HUAWEI-bgp-af-ipv4] peer FE80::1 advertise-community

```
