Usage Guidelines
----------------

**Usage Scenario**

By default, after a routing protocol imports an IPv6 host route from a directly connected interface, the routing protocol only stores the route in the routing table and does not advertise the route. If IPv6 host routes need to be advertised, run the **ipv6 direct-routing-table local-host-route advertise enable** command to enable the IPv6 host route advertisement function on the directly connected interface.

**Precautions**

The host route of the directly connected interface mentioned in this command refers to the host route generated by configuring the network segment route on the interface. Host routes with 128-bit masks configured on interfaces are not included.


Example
-------

# Enable IPv6 host route advertisement on directly connected interfaces.

[~HUAWEI] ipv6 direct-routing-table local-host-route advertise enable
