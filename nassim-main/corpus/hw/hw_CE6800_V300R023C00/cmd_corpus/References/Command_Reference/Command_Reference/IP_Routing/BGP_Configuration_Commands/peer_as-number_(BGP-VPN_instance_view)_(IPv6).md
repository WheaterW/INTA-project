=============================================

peer as-number (BGP-VPN instance view) (IPv6)

Function
--------



The **peer as-number** command creates a peer and configures an AS number for the peer.

The **undo peer** command deletes a specified peer.



By default, no BGP peer is configured, and no AS number is specified for a peer or peer group.

**undo peer** *ipv6-address*


Parameters
----------

| Parameter | Description | Value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| *ipv6-address* | Specifies an IPv6 peer address. | The value is a 32-digit hexadecimal number, in the format of X:X:X:X:X:X:X:X. |
| *as-number* | Specifies an AS number. | For an AS number in integer format, the value ranges from 1 to 4294967295.  For an AS number in dotted notation, it is in the format of x.y, in which x and y are integers, with x ranging from 1 to 65535 and y ranging from 0 to 65535. |

Usage Guidelines
----------------

**Usage Scenario**

You can run the **peer as-number** command to create a specified peer relationship and specify the AS number of the peer.

**Precautions**

If the peer group to which a peer belongs is not configured with an AS number or the peer is not added to any peer group, deleting the AS number of the peer resets the peer relationship.Running the **undo peer** *ipv4-address*or **undo peer** *ipv6-address*command deletes all configurations related to the peer. Therefore, exercise caution when running this command.


Example
-------

# Set the AS number to 100 for IPv6 peer 2001:DB8:1::1.
```
<HUAWEI> system-view
[~HUAWEI] ip vpn-instance vpn1
[*HUAWEI-vpn-instance-vpn1] quit
[*HUAWEI] bgp 100
[*HUAWEI-bgp] vpn-instance vpn1
[*HUAWEI-bgp-instance-vpn1] peer 2001:DB8:1::1 as-number 100

```
