Usage Guidelines
----------------

**Usage Scenario**

After a self-signed certificate or local certificate is generated by the device, the certificate file is saved in the storage device as a PEM file. You can export the certificate for other devices to use. This simplifies certificate issue process.When you run the pki create-certificate command, the system asks you to enter certificate information, for example, PKI entity parameters, certificate file name, the validity time of certificate and RSA key length.

**Precautions**



The device does not provide lifecycle management for self-signed certificates. For example, self-signed certificates cannot be updated or revoked on the device. To ensure security of the device and certificates, a local certificate is recommended.
