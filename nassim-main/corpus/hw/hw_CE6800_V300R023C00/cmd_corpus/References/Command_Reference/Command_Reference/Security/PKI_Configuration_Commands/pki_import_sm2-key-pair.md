pki import sm2-key-pair
=======================

pki import sm2-key-pair

Function
--------



The **pki import sm2-key-pair** command imports the SM2 key pair to the device memory.




Format
------

**pki import sm2-key-pair** *keyname* **der** *filename* [ **exportable** ]

**pki import sm2-key-pair** *keyname* **pem** *filename* [ **exportable** ] [ **password** *password* ]

**pki import sm2-key-pair** *keyname* **pem** *filename* [ **exportable** ] **signkey** *signkey-name* [ **certificate** *certificate-name* ]


Parameters
----------

| Parameter | Description | Value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| *keyname* | Specifies the name of the SM2 key pair to be imported on the device. | The value is a string of 1 to 64 case-sensitive characters without spaces or question marks (?). The character string can contain spaces if it is enclosed with double quotation marks (""). |
| **der** *filename* | Specifies the format of the imported SM2 key pair as DER, and specifies the name of the file that stores the SM2 key pair. | The value must be an existing SM2 key pair name. |
| **exportable** | Indicates that the imported SM2 key pair can be exported. | - |
| **pem** *filename* | Specifies the format of the SM2 key pair to be imported as PEM, and specifies the name of the file that stores the SM2 key pair. | The value must be an existing SM2 key pair name. |
| **password** *password* | Specifies the decryption password of the SM2 key pair. The decryption password is the same as the password configured using the pki export sm2-key-pair command. | The value must be the existing decryption password of the SM2 key pair file. |
| **signkey** *signkey-name* | Specifies the name of a signature key pair. | The value is a string of 1 to 64 case-sensitive characters. It cannot contain spaces. |
| **certificate** *certificate-name* | Specifies the file name of an encryption certificate. | The value is a string of 1 to 64 case-sensitive characters. It cannot contain spaces. |

Usage Guidelines
----------------

**Usage Scenario**

Run this command to use the SM2 key pair, certificates, or certificate chains generated by other entities.

**Prerequisites**

The SM2 key pair and related certificates must already exist on the storage device.

**Precautions**



It is recommended that the name of the imported SM2 key pair contain a maximum of 50 characters. Because when an SM2 key pair is imported, if a certificate is imported at the same time, the PKI system adds \_local.cer or \_cax.cer after the name of the SM2 key pair to generate a new certificate file name, and saves it to the storage component. If the name of the new certificate contains more than 64 characters after the import, a new certificate file name cannot be generated correctly.When importing a certificate or key pair, ensure that the certificate or key pair is saved in the public directory. For example, go to the public directory:<huawei> cd pki<huawei> cd public/After the import succeeds, the source files in the public directory are deleted by default. If you do not need to delete them, select N as prompted to keep them.




Example
-------

# Import the SM2 key pair file aaa.pem in PEM format. The SM2 key pair name is key-1 in the system, the decryption password is YsHsjx\_202206, and the key pair is marked exportable.
```
<HUAWEI> system-view
[~HUAWEI] pki import sm2-key-pair key-1 pem aaa.pem exportable password YsHsjx_202206
 Info: Succeeded in importing the SM2 key pair in PEM format.
Warning: The file in the flash will be deleted. Please select 'N' if you want to keep it. Please select [Y/N]:y                     
Info: Delete Success.
