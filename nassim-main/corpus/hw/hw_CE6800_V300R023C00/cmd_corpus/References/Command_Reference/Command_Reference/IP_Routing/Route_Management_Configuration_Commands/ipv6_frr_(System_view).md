ipv6 frr (System view)
======================

ipv6 frr (System view)

Function
--------



The **ipv6 frr** command enables IPv6 Fast Reroute (FRR) of the public network in the system view.

The **undo ipv6 frr** command disables IPv6 FRR of the public network.



By default, IPv6 FRR of the public network is disabled.

Usage Guidelines
----------------

**Usage Scenario**

When there are public network routes generated by multiple types of routing protocols on a device, the **ipv6 frr** command can be used to enable IPv6 FRR to immediately switch traffic among routes and ensure uninterrupted traffic forwarding if certain routes are faulty.

**Configuration Impact**

When the **ipv6 frr** command is not run, the system only selects a group of optimal protocol routes as active routes. After the **ipv6 frr** command is run, the system selects a group of sub-optimal protocol routes as the backup of related active routes.

**Precautions**

Note:A routing loop may occur after the **ipv6 frr** command is run because the command is used to enable routes generated by different routing protocols to back up each other. Therefore, exercise caution when running the command.


Example
-------

# Enable IPv6 FRR of the public network in the system view.
```
<HUAWEI> system-view
[~HUAWEI] ipv6 frr

```
