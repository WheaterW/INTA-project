**Table 1** Description of the **display ospfv3 request-list** command output
| Item | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Interface | Interface that connects with the neighbor. |
| Area-ID | ID of the area to which the interface belongs. |
| Nbr-ID | Neighbor ID. |
| LS-Type | LSA type:   * Link-LSA: is generated by the router for each link and is advertised in the local link. * Router-LSA: is generated by each router and advertised in the area where the router resides. It describes the link state and cost of the router. * Intra-Area-Prefix-LSA:   + An LSA generated on a router describes the IPv6 address prefix associated with the router LSA.   + An LSA generated on a DR describes the IPv6 address prefix associated with the network LSA. * AS-External-LSA: is generated by the ASBR and is advertised to the entire AS (except the stub area). It describes the routes that reach other ASs. |
| LS-ID | Link State ID (in the LSA header). |
| AdvRouter | Advertising router (in the LSA header). |
| SeqNum | Sequence number (in the LSA header). |
| Age | Aging time (in the LSA header). |
