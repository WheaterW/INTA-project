Usage Guidelines
----------------

**Usage Scenario**



In an ORF scenario, if a device that does not support ORF exists on the network, you can configure the device to advertise ORF default routes to a peer group in the BGP-VPN-Target address family view to establish an ORF peer relationship.



**Precautions**



This command enables the device to advertise the default route generated by itself, and condition-based matching is not used. Therefore, you are not advised to configure if-match clauses in a route-policy.




Example
