| Remote attestation can be used only on devices with HTM modules. | CE6800 series | CE6885-48YS8CQ-T |
| The LAK is the identity certificate assigned by the user to the HTM component. By default, the device uses the IAK assigned by Huawei to the HTM component before delivery.  To enable LAK, you must configure the IP address of the server that issues certificates on the device to issue digital certificates to LAK. | CE6800 series | CE6885-48YS8CQ-T |
