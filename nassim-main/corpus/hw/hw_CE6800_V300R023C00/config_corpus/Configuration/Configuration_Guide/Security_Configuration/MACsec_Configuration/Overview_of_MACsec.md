Overview of MACsec

#### Definition

Media Access Control Security (MACsec) is a secure communication method based on 802.1AE and 802.1X that ensures device-to-device security protection for Ethernet links. It provides users with secure MAC-layer data sending and receiving services through functions such as data encryption, integrity check, and replay protection, ensuring the security of Ethernet frames.


#### Purpose

When data is transmitted in plaintext, there are many security risks, for example, bank account information is stolen and tampered with, or malicious network attacks occur. MACsec is a Layer 2 encryption technology that provides hop-by-hop secure data transmission. It protects transmitted Ethernet frames to reduce the risk of information leakage and malicious network attacks. MACsec is suitable for meeting high requirements on data confidentiality.
