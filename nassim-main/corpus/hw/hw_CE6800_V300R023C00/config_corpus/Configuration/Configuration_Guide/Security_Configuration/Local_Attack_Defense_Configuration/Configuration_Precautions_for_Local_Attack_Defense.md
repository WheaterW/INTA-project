| Proactive Source Tracing | 1. Packet statistics are collected based on the sampling algorithm. Therefore, the statistics may be inaccurate.  2. The proactive source tracing function is enabled only after statistics about packet loss in a queue caused by CPCAR exceeding are collected or port-based automatic local attack defense is enabled.  After an attack occurs, CPCAR can detect packet loss statistics only after a delay of 1 minute, and port-based automatic local attack defense can detect the attack only after a delay of more than 10s. Therefore, the proactive source tracing function has a long delay before statistics collection.  3. Statistics on discarded packets in a short period of time cannot be collected. | CE6800 series  CE8800 series | CE6820H-48S6CQ/CE6820S-48S6CQ/CE6820H-48S6CQ-K/CE6855-48XS8CQ/CE6860-HAM/CE6860-SAN/CE6863H-48S6CQ/CE6863H-48S6CQ-K/CE6866-48S8CQ-K/CE6866-48S8CQ-P/CE6881H-48S6CQ/CE6881H-48S6CQ-K/CE6881H-48T6CQ/CE6881H-48T6CQ-K/CE6885-48YS8CQ/CE6863E-48S8CQ/CE6885-LL-56F (standard forwarding mode)/CE6885-48YS8CQ-T/CE6885-LL-56F (low latency mode)/CE6885-SAN-56F  CE8850-HAM/CE8850-SAN/CE8851-32CQ8DQ-K/CE8851-32CQ8DQ-P/CE8855-32CQ4BQ/CE8851-32CQ4BQ |
| Port attack defense | 1. When a large number of attack protocols exist and the attack protocols are in the same group of queues, the rate of the protocol packets sent to the CPU is lower than the port attack defense punishment threshold due to queue rate limiting or CPU port rate limiting. As a result, attack defense punishment cannot be performed.  2. When the port attack defense threshold for a single protocol is larger than the queue rate limit or CPU port rate limit, the rate of the protocol packets sent to the CPU is lower than the port attack defense punishment threshold. As a result, attack defense punishment cannot be performed. | CE6800 series  CE8800 series | CE6820H-48S6CQ/CE6820S-48S6CQ/CE6820H-48S6CQ-K/CE6855-48XS8CQ/CE6860-HAM/CE6860-SAN/CE6863H-48S6CQ/CE6863H-48S6CQ-K/CE6866-48S8CQ-K/CE6866-48S8CQ-P/CE6881H-48S6CQ/CE6881H-48S6CQ-K/CE6881H-48T6CQ/CE6881H-48T6CQ-K/CE6885-48YS8CQ/CE6863E-48S8CQ/CE6885-LL-56F (standard forwarding mode)/CE6885-48YS8CQ-T/CE6885-LL-56F (low latency mode)/CE6885-SAN-56F  CE8850-HAM/CE8850-SAN/CE8851-32CQ8DQ-K/CE8851-32CQ8DQ-P/CE8855-32CQ4BQ/CE8851-32CQ4BQ |
| Port attack defense | Port attack defense of the IP fragment type does not take effect for VXLAN or GRE tunnel termination packets whose inner headers are IPv6 fragment headers or other IPv6 extension headers. | CE6800 series  CE8800 series | CE6860-HAM/CE6860-SAN/CE6866-48S8CQ-K/CE6866-48S8CQ-P  CE8850-HAM/CE8850-SAN/CE8851-32CQ8DQ-K/CE8851-32CQ8DQ-P |
