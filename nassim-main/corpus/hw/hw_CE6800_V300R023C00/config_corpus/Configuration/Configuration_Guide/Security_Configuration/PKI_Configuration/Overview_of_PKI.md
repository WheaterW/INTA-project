Overview of PKI

#### Definition

Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) provides certificate management in compliance with established standards. It uses public keys to provide security services for all network applications. PKI is the core of information security and basis of e-commerce.


#### Purpose

As the network and information technologies develop, e-commerce is widely used and accepted. However, e-commerce has the following problems:

* The transaction parties cannot verify the identities of each other.
* Data may be eavesdropped and tampered with during transmission. Information is not secure.
* No paper receipt is used in transaction, making arbitration difficult.

PKI uses public keys to implement identity verification, confidentiality, data integrity, and non-repudiation of transactions. Therefore, PKI is widely used in network communication and transactions, especially e-government and e-commerce.


#### Benefits

* Certificate authentication allows users to authenticate network devices to which they connect, ensuring that users connect to secure and legal networks.
* Cryptography protects data against eavesdropping so that data is securely transmitted.
* Digital signature protects data against tampering so that data is securely transmitted.
* PKI prevents unauthorized users from connecting to enterprise networks.
* PKI establishes secure connections between enterprise branches to ensure data security.
