Overview of Trusted Systems

#### Definition

To enhance system trustworthiness, you can utilize the trusted system to efficiently oversee and regulate digital signature, remote attestation, and secure boot functions on a device.

A trusted system is one in which the hardware and software are functioning as intended and designed. To ensure a system is trustworthy, it is essential that the software integrity is of the highest level, preventing any unauthorized modifications or intrusions.


#### Purpose

The proper functioning of communication networks is crucial for global communications service providers, enterprises, and governments. Also, the integrity of data and IT infrastructure is fundamental to upholding network security and fostering user trust. In today's dynamic threat landscape, safeguarding networks against intrusion, forgery, and tampering by malicious actors has become increasingly important.

A communication device comprises several embedded computer systems, which are susceptible to virus attacks, tampering, and exploitation of vulnerabilities by malicious actors through the use of Trojan horses. Once an untrusted device accesses the network, the entire network may be compromised. Therefore, to create a trusted network environment, it is essential to ensure that all connected devices are trustworthy. By utilizing digital signature, remote attestation, and secure boot, users can guarantee the trustworthiness of all network-connected devices.


#### Benefits

Trusted system functions include digital signature, remote attestation, and secure boot, which bring the following security benefits:

* Trust in the trusted boot platform can be established by utilizing device hardware capabilities and initial boot code.
* Secure boot allows only trusted devices to boot.
