| If both strict URPF and flow-matrix rules are configured and the source and destination IP addresses of a flow match the path planning rule of the flow specified in the Flow Matrix, the strict URPF mode on the outbound interface specified in the rule changes to loose URPF. | CE6800 series  CE8800 series | CE6855-48XS8CQ/CE6860-HAM/CE6860-SAN/CE6866-48S8CQ-K/CE6866-48S8CQ-P/CE6885-48YS8CQ/CE6863E-48S8CQ/CE6885-LL-56F (standard forwarding mode)/CE6885-48YS8CQ-T/CE6885-SAN-56F  CE8850-HAM/CE8850-SAN/CE8851-32CQ8DQ-K/CE8851-32CQ8DQ-P/CE8855-32CQ4BQ/CE8851-32CQ4BQ |
| BOOTP/DHCP packets with the source IP address 0.0.0.0 and destination IP address 255.255.255.255 are sent to the CPU for processing, and URPF does not take effect. | CE6800 series  CE8800 series | CE6820H-48S6CQ/CE6820S-48S6CQ/CE6820H-48S6CQ-K/CE6855-48XS8CQ/CE6860-HAM/CE6860-SAN/CE6863H-48S6CQ/CE6863H-48S6CQ-K/CE6866-48S8CQ-K/CE6866-48S8CQ-P/CE6881H-48S6CQ/CE6881H-48S6CQ-K/CE6881H-48T6CQ/CE6881H-48T6CQ-K/CE6885-48YS8CQ/CE6863E-48S8CQ/CE6885-LL-56F (standard forwarding mode)/CE6885-48YS8CQ-T/CE6885-SAN-56F  CE8850-HAM/CE8850-SAN/CE8851-32CQ8DQ-K/CE8851-32CQ8DQ-P/CE8855-32CQ4BQ/CE8851-32CQ4BQ |
| For the CE6800 Series:  If the next-hop outbound interface of the network segment route corresponding to the source IP address of some packets is the local device that sends the packets to the CPU or a blackhole route, the device with URPF configured does not verify the validity of the packets. In addition, the strict mode becomes invalid, and the loose mode is used. You can configure an ACL-based discarding policy for the source IP address of traffic to prevent the traffic from being forwarded.  For the CE6820H-48S6CQ/CE6820S-48S6CQ/CE6820H-48S6CQ-K/CE6855-48XS8CQ/CE6860-HAM/CE6860-SAN/CE6863H-48S6CQ/CE6863H-48S6CQ-K/CE6866-48S8CQ-K/CE6866-48S8CQ-P/CE6881H-48S6CQ/CE6881H-48S6CQ-K/CE6881H-48T6CQ/CE6881H-48T6CQ-K/CE6885-48YS8CQ/CE6863E-48S8CQ/CE6885-LL-56F (standard forwarding mode)/CE6885-48YS8CQ-T/CE6885-SAN-56F:  If the next-hop outbound interface of the network segment route corresponding to the source IP address of a packet is the local device or a blackhole route, the strict URPF check mode does not take effect on the interface.  You can configure an ACL-based discarding policy based on the source IP address of traffic to prevent the traffic from being forwarded.  For the CE8800 Series:  If the next-hop outbound interface of the network segment route corresponding to the source IP address of some packets is the local device that sends the packets to the CPU or a blackhole route, the device with URPF configured does not verify the validity of the packets. In addition, the strict mode becomes invalid, and the loose mode is used. You can configure an ACL-based discarding policy for the source IP address of traffic to prevent the traffic from being forwarded.  For the CE8850-HAM/CE8850-SAN/CE8851-32CQ8DQ-K/CE8851-32CQ8DQ-P/CE8855-32CQ4BQ/CE8851-32CQ4BQ:  If the next-hop outbound interface of the network segment route corresponding to the source IP address of a packet is the local device or a blackhole route, the strict URPF check mode does not take effect on the interface.  You can configure an ACL-based discarding policy based on the source IP address of traffic to prevent the traffic from being forwarded. | CE6800 series  CE8800 series | CE6820H-48S6CQ/CE6820S-48S6CQ/CE6820H-48S6CQ-K/CE6855-48XS8CQ/CE6860-HAM/CE6860-SAN/CE6863H-48S6CQ/CE6863H-48S6CQ-K/CE6866-48S8CQ-K/CE6866-48S8CQ-P/CE6881H-48S6CQ/CE6881H-48S6CQ-K/CE6881H-48T6CQ/CE6881H-48T6CQ-K/CE6885-48YS8CQ/CE6863E-48S8CQ/CE6885-LL-56F (standard forwarding mode)/CE6885-48YS8CQ-T/CE6885-SAN-56F  CE8850-HAM/CE8850-SAN/CE8851-32CQ8DQ-K/CE8851-32CQ8DQ-P/CE8855-32CQ4BQ/CE8851-32CQ4BQ |
| When the outbound interface in the routing table that matches the source IP address of Layer 3 packets is a tunnel interface (including a TE tunnel interface), if the strict mode is configured, the loose mode is automatically used. After tunneled packets are decapsulated and forwarded based on the inner IP address, URPF check is not performed on the inner IP address of the packet. | CE6800 series  CE8800 series | CE6820H-48S6CQ/CE6820S-48S6CQ/CE6820H-48S6CQ-K/CE6855-48XS8CQ/CE6860-HAM/CE6860-SAN/CE6863H-48S6CQ/CE6863H-48S6CQ-K/CE6866-48S8CQ-K/CE6866-48S8CQ-P/CE6881H-48S6CQ/CE6881H-48S6CQ-K/CE6881H-48T6CQ/CE6881H-48T6CQ-K/CE6885-48YS8CQ/CE6863E-48S8CQ/CE6885-LL-56F (standard forwarding mode)/CE6885-48YS8CQ-T/CE6885-SAN-56F  CE8850-HAM/CE8850-SAN/CE8851-32CQ8DQ-K/CE8851-32CQ8DQ-P/CE8855-32CQ4BQ/CE8851-32CQ4BQ |
| When the next hop of the FIB entry matched by the source IP address is a multi-path (including ECMP and FRR), URPF in strict mode is displayed as loose check. | CE6800 series  CE8800 series | CE6820H-48S6CQ/CE6820S-48S6CQ/CE6820H-48S6CQ-K/CE6855-48XS8CQ/CE6860-HAM/CE6860-SAN/CE6863H-48S6CQ/CE6863H-48S6CQ-K/CE6866-48S8CQ-K/CE6866-48S8CQ-P/CE6881H-48S6CQ/CE6881H-48S6CQ-K/CE6881H-48T6CQ/CE6881H-48T6CQ-K/CE6885-48YS8CQ/CE6863E-48S8CQ/CE6885-LL-56F (standard forwarding mode)/CE6885-48YS8CQ-T/CE6885-SAN-56F  CE8850-HAM/CE8850-SAN/CE8851-32CQ8DQ-K/CE8851-32CQ8DQ-P/CE8855-32CQ4BQ/CE8851-32CQ4BQ |
| If both strict URPF and flow-matrix rules are configured and the source and destination IP addresses of a flow match the path planning rule of the flow specified in the Flow Matrix, the strict URPF mode on the outbound interface specified in the rule changes to loose URPF. | CE6800 series  CE8800 series | CE6855-48XS8CQ/CE6860-HAM/CE6860-SAN/CE6866-48S8CQ-K/CE6866-48S8CQ-P/CE6885-48YS8CQ/CE6863E-48S8CQ/CE6885-LL-56F (standard forwarding mode)/CE6885-48YS8CQ-T/CE6885-SAN-56F  CE8850-HAM/CE8850-SAN/CE8851-32CQ8DQ-K/CE8851-32CQ8DQ-P/CE8855-32CQ4BQ/CE8851-32CQ4BQ |
| Only loose URPF check is performed on ECMP routes. | CE6800 series  CE8800 series | CE6820H-48S6CQ/CE6820S-48S6CQ/CE6820H-48S6CQ-K/CE6855-48XS8CQ/CE6860-HAM/CE6860-SAN/CE6863H-48S6CQ/CE6863H-48S6CQ-K/CE6866-48S8CQ-K/CE6866-48S8CQ-P/CE6881H-48S6CQ/CE6881H-48S6CQ-K/CE6881H-48T6CQ/CE6881H-48T6CQ-K/CE6885-48YS8CQ/CE6863E-48S8CQ/CE6885-LL-56F (standard forwarding mode)/CE6885-48YS8CQ-T/CE6885-SAN-56F  CE8850-HAM/CE8850-SAN/CE8851-32CQ8DQ-K/CE8851-32CQ8DQ-P/CE8855-32CQ4BQ/CE8851-32CQ4BQ |
| If the source IP address of a packet is the IPv6 address of a host interface or the outbound interface of the routing entry corresponding to the source IP address is a tunnel interface, URPF strict check becomes invalid on the interface and the URPF loose check mode is used. | CE6800 series  CE8800 series | CE6820H-48S6CQ/CE6820S-48S6CQ/CE6820H-48S6CQ-K/CE6855-48XS8CQ/CE6860-HAM/CE6860-SAN/CE6863H-48S6CQ/CE6863H-48S6CQ-K/CE6866-48S8CQ-K/CE6866-48S8CQ-P/CE6881H-48S6CQ/CE6881H-48S6CQ-K/CE6881H-48T6CQ/CE6881H-48T6CQ-K/CE6885-48YS8CQ/CE6863E-48S8CQ/CE6885-LL-56F (standard forwarding mode)/CE6885-48YS8CQ-T/CE6885-SAN-56F  CE8850-HAM/CE8850-SAN/CE8851-32CQ8DQ-K/CE8851-32CQ8DQ-P/CE8855-32CQ4BQ/CE8851-32CQ4BQ |
