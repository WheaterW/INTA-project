Digital Signature of Software Packages
======================================

Digital Signature of Software Packages

#### Definition

The digital signature mechanism ensures the validity and integrity of software packages, which ultimately enhances the security and availability of installed software.


#### Purpose

After a software package is released, the subsequent phases of transfer, download, storage, and installation pose potential security risks, including the possibility of components being replaced or tampered with. Before a software package is released, a digital signature is embedded within it, and this signature is verified during the loading process onto a device. The software package is considered complete and trusted, and applications can be installed, only after the verification succeeds.


#### Benefits

When you set up a patch or system software package for the next boot or install a patch, the digital signature is verified to ensure the integrity of the system software package or patch.
