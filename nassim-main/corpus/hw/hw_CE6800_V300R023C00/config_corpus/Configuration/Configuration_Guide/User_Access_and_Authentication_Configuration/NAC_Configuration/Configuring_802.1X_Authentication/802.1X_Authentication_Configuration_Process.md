802.1X Authentication Configuration Process
===========================================

802.1X Authentication Configuration Process

#### Pre-configuration Tasks

NAC only provides multiple network access control protocols for users. To implement user authentication and control users' network access rights, complete the following AAA configuration tasks before configuring NAC:

* Configure the domain to which a user belongs and AAA schemes to be used by the user.
* Configure the user name and password on the RADIUS or HWTACACS server if RADIUS or HWTACACS authentication is used.
* Configure the user name and password manually on the access device if local authentication is used.

For details on how to configure the AAA client, see [AAA Configuration](galaxy_aaa_cfg_0001.html).
