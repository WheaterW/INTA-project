Overview of the System Master Key

#### Definition

A system master key is used to encrypt and decrypt locally stored data. A fixed default master key is provided before device delivery. In actual network environments, the default master key may be stolen or cracked. Administrators can manually change the master keys as required to improve data security. You can also enable the automatic update of the system master key. The system then periodically generates a new master key to reduce the workload of manually maintaining the master key.


#### Purpose

The system master key can be configured to improve data security and reliability.
