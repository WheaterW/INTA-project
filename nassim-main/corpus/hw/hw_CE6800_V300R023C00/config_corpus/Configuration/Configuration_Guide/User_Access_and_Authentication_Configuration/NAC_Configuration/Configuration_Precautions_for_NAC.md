| 802.1X authentication | For the CE6800 Series:  802.1X application limitations in different scenarios:  1. If the 802.1X client uses MD5 encryption, the user authentication mode on the device can be set to EAP or CHAP.  2. If the 802.1X client uses PEAP authentication, the authentication mode on the device can be set to EAP.  3. The authentication mode for 802.1X users can be set to EAP relay only when RADIUS authentication or local EAP authentication is used.  4. When AAA local authentication is used, the authentication mode for 802.1X users can only be set to EAP termination.  5. When AD or LDAP authentication is used, the authentication mode for 802.1X users must be set to PAP.  6. Terminals such as laptops support EAP termination only after third-party clients are installed.  7. When the account information of 802.1X users is stored on the AD/LDAP server, it is recommended that the device be connected to the RADIUS server. The RADIUS server is connected to the AD/LDAP server and authenticates terminals through PAP (non-plaintext, RADIUS shared key for encrypted transmission), MS-CHAPv2, or EAP TLS.  8. When the number of 802.1X users exceeds the upper limit or users are authorized, for example, ACLs and upstream and downstream CAR are authorized, you are advised to manually adjust the CPCAR value for 802.1X packets to prevent user login failures or user logouts due to re-authentication. | CE6800 series | CE6820H-48S6CQ/CE6820S-48S6CQ/CE6820H-48S6CQ-K/CE6863H-48S6CQ/CE6863H-48S6CQ-K/CE6881H-48S6CQ/CE6881H-48S6CQ-K/CE6881H-48T6CQ/CE6881H-48T6CQ-K |
| User connection management | For the CE6800 Series:  NAC access authentication has the following limitations:  1. QinQ access is not supported.  2. Dot1q access is not supported.  3. VLAN mapping access is not supported.  4. VLAN stacking access is not supported.  5. NAC authentication cannot be enabled on both a Layer 2 Ethernet interface and the VLANIF interface of the VLAN to which the Layer 2 Ethernet interface belongs.  6. Users with the same IPv6 address but from different VPNs cannot all go online.  7. Different values configured using the access-limit user-name max-num command cannot be authorized to the same account.  8. Authentication cannot be triggered by packets carrying three or more VLAN tags.  9. Interface binding authentication is mutually exclusive with the following configurations:  (1) ip-subnet-vlan enable  (2) mac-vlan enable  (3) mac-address limit  (4) mac-address learning disable  10. If NAC authentication is enabled on a physical interface or trunk interface but authentication triggered through DHCPv4/v6 packets is disabled, DHCP packets are sent to the DHCP module. If authentication triggered through ARP packets is disabled, the device still learns ARP entries.  11. ARP and ND learning cannot be triggered when ARP/ND request packets are sent for user aging detection and ARP/ND reply packets are sent from terminals.  12. When a user updates the IPv6 address, if there are 10 IPv6 addresses, the link-local address is preferentially updated when the user updates the IPv6 address again.  13. When the MAC address of a user is a virtual MAC address, static MAC address, blackhole MAC address, or multicast MAC address, the user cannot be authenticated.  NAC authentication and M-LAG are mutually exclusive. | CE6800 series | CE6820H-48S6CQ/CE6820S-48S6CQ/CE6820H-48S6CQ-K/CE6863H-48S6CQ/CE6863H-48S6CQ-K/CE6881H-48S6CQ/CE6881H-48S6CQ-K/CE6881H-48T6CQ/CE6881H-48T6CQ-K |
| User connection management | For the CE6800 Series:  Limitations on authorization of DSCP and 802.1p priorities together with the trust dscp/8021p command:  1. Uplink user traffic:  (1) When both DSCP authorization and 802.1p authorization are configured, DSCP values are used for internal priority mapping.  (2) When the trust dscp command is run on the outbound interface of a packet, the user is authorized the DSCP value. The device uses the authorized DSCP value to map the packet to the queue. The DSCP value carried in the packet may not be the same as the authorized value. For details, see the mapping in the product documentation.  (3) When the user is authorized the DSCP value and the outbound interface is configured with the trust 8021p command, the device performs internal priority mapping based on the authorized DSCP value and adds the reverse mapping value to the 802.1p field of the packet on the outbound interface. The DSCP field value of the packet is the authorized value.  2. The downlink user traffic can carry the authorized DSCP and 802.1p values, and the number of online users is limited by ACL resources.  3. 802.1p authorization does not take effect in VXLAN scenarios (user VLAN tags are removed in VXLAN scenarios).  When both DSCP authorization and 802.1p authorization are configured, DSCP values are used for internal priority mapping. | CE6800 series | CE6820H-48S6CQ/CE6820S-48S6CQ/CE6820H-48S6CQ-K/CE6863H-48S6CQ/CE6863H-48S6CQ-K/CE6881H-48S6CQ/CE6881H-48S6CQ-K/CE6881H-48T6CQ/CE6881H-48T6CQ-K |
| User connection management | For the CE6800 Series:  VLAN authorization limitations:  1. The following limitations apply to VLAN authorization of users in MAC-base mode:  (1) In standalone scenarios, access and trunk interfaces do not support VLAN authorization, and hybrid interfaces support VLAN authorization.  (2) If a user packet carries a VLAN tag, the VLAN ID must be the same as the PVID of the interface so that the server can dynamically authorize the VLAN to the user.  2. The following limitations apply to VLAN authorization of users in port-base mode: VLAN authorization can be performed on hybrid and trunk interfaces but not on access interfaces.  3. When STP multi-instance is configured, the authorized VLAN and PVID must be in the same instance. Otherwise, service traffic cannot be forwarded.  4. VLAN authorization cannot be performed on VLANIF interfaces.  5. VLAN authorization cannot be performed for users with double-tagged VLANs.  6. The authorized VLAN cannot be the same as the PNP VLAN, voice VLAN, or ERPS control VLAN.  7. The priority of the authorized VLAN is lower than that of the VLAN configured using the lldp auto-vlan tagged <vlan-id> sensor ap command.  8. If an authorized VLAN is manually configured and then an interface is added to the VLAN in tagged mode, the interface is added to the authorized VLAN in tagged mode. If an interface is added to a VLAN in tagged mode and then the VLAN is authorized after a user goes online, the interface is added to the VLAN in untagged mode. | CE6800 series | CE6820H-48S6CQ/CE6820S-48S6CQ/CE6820H-48S6CQ-K/CE6863H-48S6CQ/CE6863H-48S6CQ-K/CE6881H-48S6CQ/CE6881H-48S6CQ-K/CE6881H-48T6CQ/CE6881H-48T6CQ-K |
