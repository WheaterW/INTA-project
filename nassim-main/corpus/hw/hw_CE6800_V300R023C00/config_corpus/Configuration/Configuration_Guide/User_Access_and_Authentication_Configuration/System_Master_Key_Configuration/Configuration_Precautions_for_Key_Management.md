| System Master Key Management | The interval between two consecutive master key settings must be 3 minutes. | CE6800 series  CE8800 series | CE6820H-48S6CQ/CE6820S-48S6CQ/CE6820H-48S6CQ-K/CE6855-48XS8CQ/CE6860-SAN/CE6863H-48S6CQ/CE6863H-48S6CQ-K/CE6866-48S8CQ-K/CE6866-48S8CQ-P/CE6860-HAM/CE6881H-48S6CQ/CE6881H-48S6CQ-K/CE6881H-48T6CQ/CE6881H-48T6CQ-K/CE6885-48YS8CQ/CE6863E-48S8CQ/CE6885-48YS8CQ-T/CE6885-SAN-56F/CE6885-LL-56F (standard forwarding mode)/CE6885-LL-56F (low latency mode)  CE8850-SAN/CE8851-32CQ8DQ-K/CE8851-32CQ8DQ-P/CE8850-HAM/CE8855-32CQ4BQ/CE8851-32CQ4BQ |
| System Master Key Management | If the system master key is automatically generated, it is automatically updated periodically. After the update, the ciphertext configuration in the configuration file is encrypted using the new system master key to generate a new ciphertext character string. That is, the ciphertext configuration character string in the configuration file is updated.  Run the display master-key configuration command to view the update interval.  You can run the set master-key update-days command in the diagnostic view to change the update interval. | CE6800 series  CE8800 series | CE6820H-48S6CQ/CE6820S-48S6CQ/CE6820H-48S6CQ-K/CE6855-48XS8CQ/CE6860-SAN/CE6863H-48S6CQ/CE6863H-48S6CQ-K/CE6866-48S8CQ-K/CE6866-48S8CQ-P/CE6860-HAM/CE6881H-48S6CQ/CE6881H-48S6CQ-K/CE6881H-48T6CQ/CE6881H-48T6CQ-K/CE6885-48YS8CQ/CE6863E-48S8CQ/CE6885-48YS8CQ-T/CE6885-SAN-56F/CE6885-LL-56F (standard forwarding mode)/CE6885-LL-56F (low latency mode)  CE8850-SAN/CE8851-32CQ8DQ-K/CE8851-32CQ8DQ-P/CE8850-HAM/CE8855-32CQ4BQ/CE8851-32CQ4BQ |
| System Master Key Management | To ensure security, different ciphertexts are generated when the same cleartext is reconfigured. | CE6800 series  CE8800 series | CE6820H-48S6CQ/CE6820S-48S6CQ/CE6820H-48S6CQ-K/CE6855-48XS8CQ/CE6860-SAN/CE6863H-48S6CQ/CE6863H-48S6CQ-K/CE6866-48S8CQ-K/CE6866-48S8CQ-P/CE6860-HAM/CE6881H-48S6CQ/CE6881H-48S6CQ-K/CE6881H-48T6CQ/CE6881H-48T6CQ-K/CE6885-48YS8CQ/CE6863E-48S8CQ/CE6885-48YS8CQ-T/CE6885-SAN-56F/CE6885-LL-56F (standard forwarding mode)/CE6885-LL-56F (low latency mode)  CE8850-SAN/CE8851-32CQ8DQ-K/CE8851-32CQ8DQ-P/CE8850-HAM/CE8855-32CQ4BQ/CE8851-32CQ4BQ |
| System Master Key Management | When a configuration file is copied from another device to the current device as the configuration file for next startup, if the master key of the other device does not exist on the current device, the configuration fails. You can use either of the following methods to rectify the fault:  Change the master key of the device to be configured to be the same as that of the device that provides the configuration file.  Change the master key of the device that provides the configuration file to be the same as that of the device to be configured. Run the save [configuration-file] command to save and export the configuration file, upload the configuration file to the device to be configured, and run the startup saved-configuration configuration-file command to specify the configuration file for next startup.  For details, see "Reusing the Configuration File of Another Device" in the Configuration Guide - Basic Configuration - Configuration File Management Configuration. | CE6800 series  CE8800 series | CE6820H-48S6CQ/CE6820S-48S6CQ/CE6820H-48S6CQ-K/CE6855-48XS8CQ/CE6860-SAN/CE6863H-48S6CQ/CE6863H-48S6CQ-K/CE6866-48S8CQ-K/CE6866-48S8CQ-P/CE6860-HAM/CE6881H-48S6CQ/CE6881H-48S6CQ-K/CE6881H-48T6CQ/CE6881H-48T6CQ-K/CE6885-48YS8CQ/CE6863E-48S8CQ/CE6885-48YS8CQ-T/CE6885-SAN-56F/CE6885-LL-56F (standard forwarding mode)/CE6885-LL-56F (low latency mode)  CE8850-SAN/CE8851-32CQ8DQ-K/CE8851-32CQ8DQ-P/CE8850-HAM/CE8855-32CQ4BQ/CE8851-32CQ4BQ |
| System Master Key Management | After the master key is changed, if the master key of another device does not exist in the master key stored on the current device when the encrypted file is copied from another device to the current device, the current device cannot decrypt the copied encrypted file because the master key does not match. You can use either of the following methods to rectify the fault:  Change the master key of the current device to be the same as that of the device that provides the encrypted file.  Change the master key of the device that provides the encrypted file to be the same as that of the current device. Then, the user exports the encrypted file again and uploads it to the current device for decryption. | CE6800 series  CE8800 series | CE6820H-48S6CQ/CE6820S-48S6CQ/CE6820H-48S6CQ-K/CE6855-48XS8CQ/CE6860-SAN/CE6863H-48S6CQ/CE6863H-48S6CQ-K/CE6866-48S8CQ-K/CE6866-48S8CQ-P/CE6860-HAM/CE6881H-48S6CQ/CE6881H-48S6CQ-K/CE6881H-48T6CQ/CE6881H-48T6CQ-K/CE6885-48YS8CQ/CE6863E-48S8CQ/CE6885-48YS8CQ-T/CE6885-SAN-56F/CE6885-LL-56F (standard forwarding mode)/CE6885-LL-56F (low latency mode)  CE8850-SAN/CE8851-32CQ8DQ-K/CE8851-32CQ8DQ-P/CE8850-HAM/CE8855-32CQ4BQ/CE8851-32CQ4BQ |
| System Master Key Management | Pay attention to the following points when changing the master key:  To ensure device security, periodically change the system master key.  After the new master key is entered, you need to enter Y on the terminal interface to proceed to the next step. If you enter N, the system exits the master key change.  You need to enter the new master key twice. The system proceeds to the next step only when the two new master keys are the same.  If an error occurs when you change the master key, the system displays a message indicating that the master key fails to be changed and advises you to try again. If the failure persists, contact technical support. | CE6800 series  CE8800 series | CE6820H-48S6CQ/CE6820S-48S6CQ/CE6820H-48S6CQ-K/CE6855-48XS8CQ/CE6860-SAN/CE6863H-48S6CQ/CE6863H-48S6CQ-K/CE6866-48S8CQ-K/CE6866-48S8CQ-P/CE6860-HAM/CE6881H-48S6CQ/CE6881H-48S6CQ-K/CE6881H-48T6CQ/CE6881H-48T6CQ-K/CE6885-48YS8CQ/CE6863E-48S8CQ/CE6885-48YS8CQ-T/CE6885-SAN-56F/CE6885-LL-56F (standard forwarding mode)/CE6885-LL-56F (low latency mode)  CE8850-SAN/CE8851-32CQ8DQ-K/CE8851-32CQ8DQ-P/CE8850-HAM/CE8855-32CQ4BQ/CE8851-32CQ4BQ |
