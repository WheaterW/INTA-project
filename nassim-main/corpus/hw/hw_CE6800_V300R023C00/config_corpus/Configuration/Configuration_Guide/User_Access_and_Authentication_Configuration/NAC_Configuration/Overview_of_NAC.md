Overview of NAC

#### Definition

Network Access Control (NAC) implements security control on users and terminals that attempt to access the network in various ways. It allows only authorized users and terminals to access the network and isolates unauthorized and insecure users and terminals. This approach improves the security protection of the entire network.


#### NAC and AAA

In actual applications, NAC and AAA work together to implement user access authentication.

* NAC is used for interaction between users and access devices. NAC controls the user access mode, as well as the parameters and timers used during user access. It ensures secure and stable connections between authorized users and access devices.
* AAA is used for interaction between access devices and authentication servers. An AAA server performs authentication, authorization, and accounting on access users to control whether the users pass the authentication and control the rights of authenticated users or resources accessible to authenticated users.
