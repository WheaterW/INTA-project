Basic Concepts of IP Multicast

#### Multicast Group

A group of receivers identified by an IP multicast address. User hosts (or other receiver devices) that have joined a multicast group become members of the group and can identify and receive multicast data sent to the multicast group.


#### Multicast Group Member

A host that has joined a multicast group. Memberships of a multicast group change dynamically. Hosts can join or leave a multicast group at any time. Members of a multicast group can be located anywhere on a network.


#### Multicast Source

The information sender is called a multicast source, and a multicast group address is the destination address. A multicast source can simultaneously send data to multiple multicast groups, and multiple multicast sources can also send data to a multicast group simultaneously. Typically, a multicast source does not need to join a multicast group.


#### Multicast Device

A router or switch supporting Layer 3 multicast. Multicast devices provide multicast routing functions, and those connected to a user network segment also provide multicast member management functions.
