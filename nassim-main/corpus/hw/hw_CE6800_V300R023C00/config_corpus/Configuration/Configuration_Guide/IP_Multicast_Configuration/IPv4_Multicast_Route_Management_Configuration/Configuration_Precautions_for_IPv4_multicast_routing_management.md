Configuration Precautions for IPv4 multicast routing management

#### Licensing Requirements

IPv4 multicast route management is a basic software function. The basic software function license has been installed and activated before delivery. You do not need to manually activate it.

| In a multicast scenario with equal-cost links or primary and secondary links, PIM is enabled only for the active link in use, but not enabled on the other links. After a link switchover occurs due to a configuration, route, or link change, multicast services will be interrupted, because PIM is not enabled on the newly selected link.  If multicast services are transmitted over the optimal route among unequal-cost links, PIM must also be enabled. | CE6800 series  CE8800 series | CE6820H-48S6CQ/CE6820S-48S6CQ/CE6820H-48S6CQ-K/CE6855-48XS8CQ/CE6860-HAM/CE6860-SAN/CE6863H-48S6CQ/CE6863H-48S6CQ-K/CE6866-48S8CQ-K/CE6866-48S8CQ-P/CE6881H-48S6CQ/CE6881H-48S6CQ-K/CE6881H-48T6CQ/CE6881H-48T6CQ-K/CE6885-48YS8CQ/CE6863E-48S8CQ/CE6885-LL-56F (standard forwarding mode)/CE6885-48YS8CQ-T/CE6885-LL-56F (low latency mode)/CE6885-SAN-56F  CE8850-HAM/CE8850-SAN/CE8851-32CQ8DQ-K/CE8851-32CQ8DQ-P/CE8855-32CQ4BQ/CE8851-32CQ4BQ |
| For the CE8800 Series:  The following types of outbound interfaces are supported by multicast RPF routes:  1. Common physical outbound interface.  2. Outbound interface of an LDP tunnel. The tunnel can be recursed to a physical outbound interface.  3. Outbound interface of the TE tunnel, which is the outbound interface of the IGP Shortcut route.  4. Outbound interface of the VXLAN tunnel. The VXLAN tunnel is used as the IPMSI tunnel of the NG MVPN.  If the outbound interface of the multicast RPF route is not one of the supported types, multicast traffic cannot be forwarded.

| For the CE8800 Series:  When Layer 2 multicast packets are discarded due to source pruning or the TTL value of Layer 3 multicast packets is 1, the discarded packets occupy the bandwidth of the outbound interface. As a result, the bandwidth of outgoing packets on the outbound interface cannot reach the maximum bandwidth.
