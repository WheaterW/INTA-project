| IGMP message transmit and receive ends must have the same Router-Alert option configuration on the same network segment. | CE6800 series  CE8800 series | CE6820H-48S6CQ/CE6820S-48S6CQ/CE6820H-48S6CQ-K/CE6855-48XS8CQ/CE6860-HAM/CE6860-SAN/CE6863H-48S6CQ/CE6863H-48S6CQ-K/CE6866-48S8CQ-K/CE6866-48S8CQ-P/CE6881H-48S6CQ/CE6881H-48S6CQ-K/CE6881H-48T6CQ/CE6881H-48T6CQ-K/CE6885-48YS8CQ/CE6863E-48S8CQ/CE6885-LL-56F (standard forwarding mode)/CE6885-48YS8CQ-T/CE6885-LL-56F (low latency mode)/CE6885-SAN-56F  CE8850-HAM/CE8850-SAN/CE8851-32CQ8DQ-K/CE8851-32CQ8DQ-P/CE8855-32CQ4BQ/CE8851-32CQ4BQ |
| During the configuration, ensure that the interval for sending general query messages is greater than the maximum response time of Query messages but smaller than the keepalive time of other IGMP queriers. | CE6800 series  CE8800 series | CE6820H-48S6CQ/CE6820S-48S6CQ/CE6820H-48S6CQ-K/CE6855-48XS8CQ/CE6860-HAM/CE6860-SAN/CE6863H-48S6CQ/CE6863H-48S6CQ-K/CE6866-48S8CQ-K/CE6866-48S8CQ-P/CE6881H-48S6CQ/CE6881H-48S6CQ-K/CE6881H-48T6CQ/CE6881H-48T6CQ-K/CE6885-48YS8CQ/CE6863E-48S8CQ/CE6885-LL-56F (standard forwarding mode)/CE6885-48YS8CQ-T/CE6885-LL-56F (low latency mode)/CE6885-SAN-56F  CE8850-HAM/CE8850-SAN/CE8851-32CQ8DQ-K/CE8851-32CQ8DQ-P/CE8855-32CQ4BQ/CE8851-32CQ4BQ |
| IGMPv1 does not support querier election. An IGMPv1 querier is designated by the upper-layer protocol, such as PIM. In this document version, querier election can be implemented only among multicast devices that run the same MLD version on a network segment. You must configure the same IGMP version on all multicast devices on the same network segment to ensure that the devices can work properly. | CE6800 series  CE8800 series | CE6820H-48S6CQ/CE6820S-48S6CQ/CE6820H-48S6CQ-K/CE6855-48XS8CQ/CE6860-HAM/CE6860-SAN/CE6863H-48S6CQ/CE6863H-48S6CQ-K/CE6866-48S8CQ-K/CE6866-48S8CQ-P/CE6881H-48S6CQ/CE6881H-48S6CQ-K/CE6881H-48T6CQ/CE6881H-48T6CQ-K/CE6885-48YS8CQ/CE6863E-48S8CQ/CE6885-LL-56F (standard forwarding mode)/CE6885-48YS8CQ-T/CE6885-LL-56F (low latency mode)/CE6885-SAN-56F  CE8850-HAM/CE8850-SAN/CE8851-32CQ8DQ-K/CE8851-32CQ8DQ-P/CE8855-32CQ4BQ/CE8851-32CQ4BQ |
| If the igmp enable command is run on the interface connected to users, PIM must also be enabled; otherwise, multicast traffic cannot be forwarded. | CE6800 series  CE8800 series | CE6820H-48S6CQ/CE6820S-48S6CQ/CE6820H-48S6CQ-K/CE6855-48XS8CQ/CE6860-HAM/CE6860-SAN/CE6863H-48S6CQ/CE6863H-48S6CQ-K/CE6866-48S8CQ-K/CE6866-48S8CQ-P/CE6881H-48S6CQ/CE6881H-48S6CQ-K/CE6881H-48T6CQ/CE6881H-48T6CQ-K/CE6885-48YS8CQ/CE6863E-48S8CQ/CE6885-LL-56F (standard forwarding mode)/CE6885-48YS8CQ-T/CE6885-LL-56F (low latency mode)/CE6885-SAN-56F  CE8850-HAM/CE8850-SAN/CE8851-32CQ8DQ-K/CE8851-32CQ8DQ-P/CE8855-32CQ4BQ/CE8851-32CQ4BQ |
| 1. When the multicast source is located on the user side of the M-LAG, ensure that the multicast source is dual-homed to the M-LAG.  2. In addition to the peer-link, a Layer 3 link must be directly connected between the M-LAG master and backup devices. STP does not need to be enabled on the interfaces at both ends of the Layer 3 link.  3. On the M-LAG master and backup devices, PIM-SM and IGMP must be enabled on all VLANIF interfaces that need to run Layer 3 multicast services, and IGMP snooping must be enabled in the corresponding VLANs.  4. If the Layer 3 link between the M-LAG master and backup devices is connected through a VLANIF interface, PIM must be enabled on the VLANIF interface, and the VLAN corresponding to the VLANIF interface must not be allowed on the peer-link interface.  5. If the peer-link is selected as the optimal link to the RP or multicast source, multicast traffic with the peer-link interface as the outbound interface may fail to be forwarded. To prevent this problem, ensure that the route cost of the Layer 3 link between the M-LAG master and backup devices is less than or equal to the route cost of the peer-link, so that the Layer 3 link between the M-LAG master and backup devices is selected during unicast route selection. | CE6800 series  CE8800 series | CE6820H-48S6CQ/CE6820S-48S6CQ/CE6820H-48S6CQ-K/CE6855-48XS8CQ/CE6860-HAM/CE6860-SAN/CE6863H-48S6CQ/CE6863H-48S6CQ-K/CE6866-48S8CQ-K/CE6866-48S8CQ-P/CE6881H-48S6CQ/CE6881H-48S6CQ-K/CE6881H-48T6CQ/CE6881H-48T6CQ-K/CE6885-48YS8CQ/CE6863E-48S8CQ/CE6885-LL-56F (standard forwarding mode)/CE6885-48YS8CQ-T/CE6885-LL-56F (low latency mode)/CE6885-SAN-56F  CE8850-HAM/CE8850-SAN/CE8851-32CQ8DQ-K/CE8851-32CQ8DQ-P/CE8855-32CQ4BQ/CE8851-32CQ4BQ |
