Overview of Congestion Management

#### Definition

When a network is intermittently congested and latency-sensitive services require higher bandwidth than others, congestion management adjusts the order in which packets are scheduled.


#### Purpose

On a traditional network, QoS issues are primarily caused by network congestion due to insufficient network resources. Congestion extends the delay of packet transmission, lowers the throughput, and consumes many resources. However, network congestion is very common in a complex environment with a variety of services. When network congestion occurs, packets are buffered in queues. Congestion management schedules the packets based on a scheduling algorithm, ensuring that QoS-demanding services (such as latency-sensitive services) are preferentially scheduled.
