| Traffic policy | For the CE8800 Series:  Traffic policy resource usage:  - To apply a traffic policy, the device must have sufficient ACL resources. Otherwise, the traffic policy fails to be applied. The ACL resource usage depends on the configuration.  (1) If if-match acl and if-match ipv6 acl are configured in a traffic classifier, a single rule in an ACL group occupies one ACL resource. If a Layer 4 port number range is configured in a rule, the rule is split. You can run the display system tcam acl port-division command to query the number of split rules. If tcp-flag established is configured in a rule, the rule occupies two ACL resources. If the rule references an IP address pool or Layer 4 port number pool, the number of ACL resources occupied by the rule depends on the pool configuration.  (2) If if-match vlan/inner-vlan is configured in a traffic classifier, the number of occupied ACL resources is affected by the VLAN ID range. You can run the display system tcam acl port-division command to query the number of split ACL rules.  (3) Multiple values can be specified for an if-match matching rule in a traffic classifier. For example, if if-match 8021p 2 3 is configured, the number of occupied ACL resources is the same as the number of values.  (4) The AND and OR modes in a traffic policy affect ACL resource usage. In AND mode, all if-match matching rules except if-match acl/ipv6 acl are combined with ACL rules. For example, if if-match acl 3000 and if-match source-mac are configured in a traffic classifier and three rules are configured in ACL 3000 (assuming that there are three rules after splitting), three ACL resources are occupied in AND mode, and four ACL resources are occupied in OR mode. Note that different values of the same if-match matching rule cannot be combined. For example, if if-match acl 3000 and if-match vlan 1 to 2 are configured in a traffic classifier, three rules are configured in ACL 3000 (assuming that there are three rules after splitting), and two rules are occupied after vlan 1 to 2 is split. In AND mode, six (3 x 2 = 6) ACL resources are occupied. (A flow cannot match both VLAN 1 and VLAN 2. Therefore, three rules are generated by combining VLAN 1 and ACL rules, and another three rules are generated by combining VLAN 2 and ACL rules.) In OR mode, five ACL resources are occupied.  - Traffic policies applied in different views and two traffic policies applied in the same view can be matched concurrently. Therefore, ACL rules must be delivered to different banks of the chip. As a result, traffic policies may fail to be applied because there are no bank resources even though the chip has available ACL rule resources. The same applies to different services that use ACL resources.  For the CE6800 Series:  Traffic policy resource usage:  - To apply a traffic policy, the device must have sufficient ACL resources.

| Traffic policy | For the CE6800 Series:  The sequence for traffic policies to take effect is described as follows:  For the CE6863H-48S6CQ/CE6863H-48S6CQ-K/CE6881H-48S6CQ/CE6881H-48S6CQ-K/CE6881H-48T6CQ/CE6881H-48T6CQ-K:  - A traffic policy in the following views takes effect in descending order of priority: sub-interface > interface > VLAN, VLANIF interface, BD, or VBDIF interface.  - A traffic policy in the following views takes effect in descending order of priority: VPN instance > system.  - Two traffic policies can be configured in the same view and in the same direction. If the first traffic policy is matched, the second traffic policy will not be matched. If the first traffic policy is not matched, the device continues to match the second traffic policy.  For the CE6885-LL-56F (low latency mode):  - If actions conflict (for example, deny and redirection), a traffic policy in the following views can take effect simultaneously in descending order of priority: sub-interface > interface > VLAN, VLANIF interface, BD, or VBDIF interface > VPN instance > system.  - Two traffic policies can be configured in the same view and in the same direction. The two traffic policies can take effect simultaneously. If actions conflict (for example, deny and redirection), the traffic policies take effect based on the sequence in which they are configured in the view.

Therefore, when configuring the 802.1p or DSCP value re-marking action in a traffic policy, you are advised to configure the internal priority re-marking action in the traffic policy on the inbound interface or disable priority mapping on the outbound interface.  - Two traffic policies can be configured in the same view and in the same direction. The two traffic policies can take effect simultaneously. If actions conflict (for example, deny and redirection), the traffic policies take effect based on the sequence in which they are configured in the view.  For the CE6820H-48S6CQ/CE6820S-48S6CQ/CE6820H-48S6CQ-K:  - A traffic policy in the following views takes effect in descending order of priority: sub-interface > interface > VLAN or VLANIF interface.  - A traffic policy in the following views takes effect in descending order of priority: VPN instance > system.  - Two traffic policies can be configured in the same view and in the same direction. If the first traffic policy is matched, the second traffic policy will not be matched. If the first traffic policy is not matched, the device continues to match the second traffic policy.

| Traffic policy | When a traffic policy is applied to a Layer 2 sub-interface:  - The traffic policy can be applied only to the inbound direction of a Dot1q, QinQ, or untagged Layer 2 sub-interface.  - Matching rules based on interface and VLAN information cannot be configured.  - If the traffic policy fails to be applied to the sub-interface because the sub-interface configuration is incomplete, no message is displayed. You can run the display traffic-policy applied-record command to check the application status.  - It is not recommended that the action of changing the VLAN ID be added to a traffic behavior. Otherwise, traffic cannot be forwarded properly because the VLAN ID changes. | CE6800 series  CE8800 series | CE6855-48XS8CQ/CE6860-HAM/CE6860-SAN/CE6863H-48S6CQ/CE6863H-48S6CQ-K/CE6866-48S8CQ-K/CE6866-48S8CQ-P/CE6881H-48S6CQ/CE6881H-48S6CQ-K/CE6881H-48T6CQ/CE6881H-48T6CQ-K/CE6885-48YS8CQ/CE6863E-48S8CQ/CE6885-LL-56F (standard forwarding mode)/CE6885-48YS8CQ-T/CE6885-SAN-56F  CE8850-HAM/CE8850-SAN/CE8851-32CQ8DQ-K/CE8851-32CQ8DQ-P/CE8855-32CQ4BQ/CE8851-32CQ4BQ |
