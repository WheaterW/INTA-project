| Limitations on deploying both traffic statistics collection and CAR on an interface:  If both traffic statistics collection and CAR are configured on a Layer 2 sub-interface, only the one that is configured later takes effect. For example, if traffic statistics collection is configured on an interface and then CAR is configured on the interface, only CAR takes effect on the interface.
