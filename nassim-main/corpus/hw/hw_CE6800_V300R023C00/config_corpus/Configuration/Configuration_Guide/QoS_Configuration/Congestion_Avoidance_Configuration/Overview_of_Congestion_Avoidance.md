Overview of Congestion Avoidance

#### Definition

Congestion avoidance is a mechanism for controlling congestion. It monitors network resources such as queues and memory buffers and discards packets when congestion occurs or worsens.


#### Purpose

On traditional networks, quality of service (QoS) issues are mainly caused by network congestion that arises from insufficient network resources. Congestion extends the delay of packet transmission, lowers the throughput, and consumes many resources. However, network congestion is very common in a complex environment with a variety of services. Congestion avoidance uses specific packet drop algorithms to prevent congestion from intensifying and make full use of network bandwidth.
