Configuring DiffServ Domain-based Priority Mapping
==================================================

Configuring DiffServ Domain-based Priority Mapping

#### Context

The process of configuring DiffServ Domain-based priority mapping is described as follows:

1. Specify the packet priority trusted by an interface so that the device performs priority mapping based on the trusted priority.
2. Configure a DiffServ domain to specify the mapping between external and internal priorities. The device can then provide differentiated QoS services based on internal priorities.
3. Apply the DiffServ domain to an object for the mapping in the DiffServ domain to take effect. By doing this, the device can re-mark priorities of packets according to these mappings.
4. Verify the configuration of the DiffServ domain.
