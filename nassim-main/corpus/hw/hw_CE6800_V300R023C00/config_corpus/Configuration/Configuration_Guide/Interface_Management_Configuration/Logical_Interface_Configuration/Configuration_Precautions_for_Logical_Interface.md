| For the CE6800 Series:  1. When the MAC address of a Layer 3 interface is a virtual MAC address, the SMAC address of the packets forwarded from the interface is not the virtual MAC address but the system MAC address.  2. If the device has only one system MAC address, the first system MAC address is used. If the device has two system MAC addresses, the second system MAC address is used. If the device has three or more system MAC addresses, the third system MAC address is used. | CE6800 series | CE6820H-48S6CQ/CE6820S-48S6CQ/CE6820H-48S6CQ-K/CE6863H-48S6CQ/CE6863H-48S6CQ-K/CE6881H-48S6CQ/CE6881H-48S6CQ-K/CE6881H-48T6CQ/CE6881H-48T6CQ-K |
| If the destination MAC address of a packet received by a Layer 3 interface is the system MAC address of the device, the device forwards the packet at Layer 3. | CE6800 series  CE8800 series | CE6820H-48S6CQ/CE6820S-48S6CQ/CE6820H-48S6CQ-K/CE6855-48XS8CQ/CE6860-HAM/CE6860-SAN/CE6863H-48S6CQ/CE6863H-48S6CQ-K/CE6866-48S8CQ-K/CE6866-48S8CQ-P/CE6881H-48S6CQ/CE6881H-48S6CQ-K/CE6881H-48T6CQ/CE6881H-48T6CQ-K/CE6885-48YS8CQ/CE6863E-48S8CQ/CE6885-LL-56F (standard forwarding mode)/CE6885-48YS8CQ-T/CE6885-LL-56F (low latency mode)/CE6885-SAN-56F  CE8850-HAM/CE8850-SAN/CE8851-32CQ8DQ-K/CE8851-32CQ8DQ-P/CE8855-32CQ4BQ/CE8851-32CQ4BQ |
