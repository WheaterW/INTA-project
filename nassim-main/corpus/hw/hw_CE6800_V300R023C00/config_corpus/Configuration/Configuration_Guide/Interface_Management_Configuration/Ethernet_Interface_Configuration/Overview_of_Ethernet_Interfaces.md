Overview of Ethernet Interfaces

#### Definition

An Ethernet interface is a medium used to connect communication devices and transmit data on an Ethernet network. Ethernet interfaces can be classified in many ways based on different classification standards.

* Based on the function, Ethernet interfaces can be classified into the following types:
  
  + MEth management interfaces: allow users to log in to the device to perform configuration and management operations. MEth management interfaces are not responsible for service transmission.
  + Service interfaces: receive and send service data.
* Based on the packet forwarding mode, Ethernet interfaces can be classified into the following types:
  
  + Layer 2 Ethernet interfaces: work at the data link layer. They can forward received packets at Layer 2 or can be added to VLANs to forward packets at Layer 3 through VLANIF interfaces.
  + Layer 3 Ethernet interfaces: work at the network layer. IP addresses can be assigned to these interfaces. They can forward received packets at Layer 3. That is, they can receive and send packets whose source and destination IP addresses are on different network segments.

* Based on the electrical attribute, Ethernet interfaces can be classified into the following types:
  + Electrical interfaces
  + Optical interfaces

#### Purpose

Ethernet interfaces provide a wide range of rates and are widely used to meet the requirements of multiple industries for high bandwidth, low costs, high security and reliability, and wide interconnection.
