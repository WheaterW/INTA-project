| Rail Group and the following functions are mutually exclusive: hash consistency, adaptive routing, UCMP, and preferential forwarding of local traffic on the telco cloud. This function is mainly reflected in the Layer 3 forwarding feature. | CE6800 series  CE8800 series | CE6855-48XS8CQ/CE6860-HAM/CE6860-SAN/CE6866-48S8CQ-K/CE6866-48S8CQ-P/CE6885-48YS8CQ/CE6863E-48S8CQ/CE6885-LL-56F (standard forwarding mode)/CE6885-48YS8CQ-T/CE6885-SAN-56F  CE8850-HAM/CE8850-SAN/CE8851-32CQ8DQ-K/CE8851-32CQ8DQ-P/CE8855-32CQ4BQ/CE8851-32CQ4BQ |
| The Rail Group function takes effect only when the function is enabled and member interfaces exist.  1. When the Rail Group function is enabled but no member interface exists, the function does not take effect.  2. When the Rail Group function is disabled, the function does not take effect even if member interfaces exist. | CE6800 series  CE8800 series | CE6855-48XS8CQ/CE6860-HAM/CE6860-SAN/CE6866-48S8CQ-K/CE6866-48S8CQ-P/CE6885-48YS8CQ/CE6863E-48S8CQ/CE6885-LL-56F (standard forwarding mode)/CE6885-48YS8CQ-T/CE6885-SAN-56F  CE8850-HAM/CE8850-SAN/CE8851-32CQ8DQ-K/CE8851-32CQ8DQ-P/CE8855-32CQ4BQ/CE8851-32CQ4BQ |
| Type of a Rail Group member interface:  1. Only physical interfaces and split interfaces are supported.  2. Peer-link interfaces are not supported.  3. Eth-Trunk interfaces and corresponding member interfaces are not supported.  4. Logical interfaces such as VLANIF and VBDIF interfaces are not supported. | CE6800 series  CE8800 series | CE6855-48XS8CQ/CE6860-HAM/CE6860-SAN/CE6866-48S8CQ-K/CE6866-48S8CQ-P/CE6885-48YS8CQ/CE6863E-48S8CQ/CE6885-LL-56F (standard forwarding mode)/CE6885-48YS8CQ-T/CE6885-SAN-56F  CE8850-HAM/CE8850-SAN/CE8851-32CQ8DQ-K/CE8851-32CQ8DQ-P/CE8855-32CQ4BQ/CE8851-32CQ4BQ |
| An interface can be added to only one Rail Group port group. | CE6800 series  CE8800 series | CE6855-48XS8CQ/CE6860-HAM/CE6860-SAN/CE6866-48S8CQ-K/CE6866-48S8CQ-P/CE6885-48YS8CQ/CE6863E-48S8CQ/CE6885-LL-56F (standard forwarding mode)/CE6885-48YS8CQ-T/CE6885-SAN-56F  CE8850-HAM/CE8850-SAN/CE8851-32CQ8DQ-K/CE8851-32CQ8DQ-P/CE8855-32CQ4BQ/CE8851-32CQ4BQ |
| The Rail Group function is supported only in the ECMP scenario of the VXLAN underlay network. If load balancing is implemented on the overlay network, the Rail Group function is not supported. | CE6800 series  CE8800 series | CE6855-48XS8CQ/CE6860-HAM/CE6860-SAN/CE6866-48S8CQ-K/CE6866-48S8CQ-P/CE6885-48YS8CQ/CE6863E-48S8CQ/CE6885-LL-56F (standard forwarding mode)/CE6885-48YS8CQ-T/CE6885-SAN-56F  CE8850-HAM/CE8850-SAN/CE8851-32CQ8DQ-K/CE8851-32CQ8DQ-P/CE8855-32CQ4BQ/CE8851-32CQ4BQ |
| The Rail Group function can be enabled using the load-balance ecmp rail-group enable command only when both the start hash value (ecmp underlay seed) and the hash algorithm offset (ecmp underlay universal-id) in the ECMP load balancing seed mode are 0. Otherwise, load imbalance occurs. | CE6800 series  CE8800 series | CE6855-48XS8CQ/CE6885-48YS8CQ/CE6863E-48S8CQ/CE6885-LL-56F (standard forwarding mode)/CE6885-48YS8CQ-T/CE6885-SAN-56F  CE8855-32CQ4BQ/CE8851-32CQ4BQ |
