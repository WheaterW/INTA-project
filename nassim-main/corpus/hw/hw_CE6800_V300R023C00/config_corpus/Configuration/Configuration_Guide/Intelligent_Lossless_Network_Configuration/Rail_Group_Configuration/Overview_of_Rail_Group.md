Overview of Rail Group

#### Definition

Rail Group is a load balancing technology used to improve network throughput.

In scenarios that require high network performance, you can configure a Rail Group port group and enable the Rail Group function to improve the network throughput. To achieve the optimal load balancing effect, conform to the following rules when configuring Rail Group port groups for different devices on the network:

* Spine node: Physical interfaces connected to the same leaf node are added to the same Rail Group port group.
* Leaf node: Physical interfaces connected to servers are added to the same Rail Group port group.
