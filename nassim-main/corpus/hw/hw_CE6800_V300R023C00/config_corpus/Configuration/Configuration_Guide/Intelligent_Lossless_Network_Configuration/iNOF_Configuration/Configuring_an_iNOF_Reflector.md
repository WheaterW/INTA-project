Configuring an iNOF Reflector
=============================

Configuring an iNOF Reflector

#### Context

Devices in an iNOF system need to manage hosts connected to the system. When there are a large number of access devices, you need to configure hosts to be managed on each access device. To simplify operations and quickly manage hosts, you can configure the iNOF reflector function so that iNOF devices exchange iNOF packets to synchronize related configurations.

If the networking is simple and related configurations do not need to be synchronized through the iNOF reflector, you can choose not to configure this function.
