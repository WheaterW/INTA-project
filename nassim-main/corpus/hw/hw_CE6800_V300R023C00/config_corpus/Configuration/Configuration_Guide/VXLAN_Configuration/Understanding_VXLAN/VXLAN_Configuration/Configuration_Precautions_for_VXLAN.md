| In an EVPN over VXLAN IPv4/IPv6 dual-stack scenario, if the number of received Add-Path routes with the same prefix exceeds the upper limit and the number of advertised Add-Path routes reaches the upper limit, the RR prefers only the maximum number of Add-Path routes allowed and advertises these routes to IPv4 or IPv6 peers. The remaining routes are not advertised. | CE6800 series  CE8800 series | CE6820H-48S6CQ/CE6820S-48S6CQ/CE6820H-48S6CQ-K/CE6855-48XS8CQ/CE6860-HAM/CE6860-SAN/CE6863H-48S6CQ/CE6863H-48S6CQ-K/CE6866-48S8CQ-K/CE6866-48S8CQ-P/CE6881H-48S6CQ/CE6881H-48S6CQ-K/CE6881H-48T6CQ/CE6881H-48T6CQ-K/CE6885-48YS8CQ/CE6863E-48S8CQ/CE6885-LL-56F (standard forwarding mode)/CE6885-48YS8CQ-T/CE6885-SAN-56F  CE8850-HAM/CE8850-SAN/CE8851-32CQ8DQ-K/CE8851-32CQ8DQ-P/CE8855-32CQ4BQ/CE8851-32CQ4BQ |

| The isolation function is configured in the same BD on the two devices that form an M-LAG. If traffic must be forwarded through a VXLAN bypass tunnel (for example, the traffic destination is a single-homing interface), the isolation function does not take effect. | CE6800 series  CE8800 series | CE6855-48XS8CQ/CE6860-HAM/CE6860-SAN/CE6863H-48S6CQ/CE6863H-48S6CQ-K/CE6866-48S8CQ-K/CE6866-48S8CQ-P/CE6881H-48S6CQ/CE6881H-48S6CQ-K/CE6881H-48T6CQ/CE6881H-48T6CQ-K/CE6885-48YS8CQ/CE6863E-48S8CQ/CE6885-LL-56F (standard forwarding mode)/CE6885-48YS8CQ-T/CE6885-SAN-56F  CE8850-HAM/CE8850-SAN/CE8851-32CQ8DQ-K/CE8851-32CQ8DQ-P/CE8855-32CQ4BQ/CE8851-32CQ4BQ |
| 1. If a Layer 2 sub-interface whose encapsulation type is default or transparent transmission is bound to a BD, VBDIF interfaces cannot be created for the BD and ARP broadcast suppression cannot be configured for the BD.  2. Data packets with VLAN tag 4095 can still be forwarded through untagged sub-interfaces.  3. An untagged Layer 2 sub-interface can remove a maximum of two VLAN tags from outgoing packets. If there are more than two VLAN tags, the sub-interface transparently transmits the packets.  4. The transparent transmission Layer 2 sub-interface does not check the VLAN ID in the outbound direction and forwards the packets that do not match the specified VLAN ID.  5. VXLAN access through global VLAN mapping VNIs and VXLAN access through QinQ Layer 2 sub-interfaces cannot coexist in the same BD.  6. Layer 2 sub-interfaces cannot be associated with the Unselect state of an Eth-Trunk interface. Eth-Trunk member interfaces in the Unselect state can still provide Layer 2 sub-interface access. To prevent this problem, configure Layer 2 sub-interfaces to inherit the loop status of the main interface. | CE6800 series  CE8800 series | CE6855-48XS8CQ/CE6860-HAM/CE6860-SAN/CE6863H-48S6CQ/CE6863H-48S6CQ-K/CE6866-48S8CQ-K/CE6866-48S8CQ-P/CE6881H-48S6CQ/CE6881H-48S6CQ-K/CE6881H-48T6CQ/CE6881H-48T6CQ-K/CE6885-48YS8CQ/CE6863E-48S8CQ/CE6885-LL-56F (standard forwarding mode)/CE6885-48YS8CQ-T/CE6885-SAN-56F  CE8850-HAM/CE8850-SAN/CE8851-32CQ8DQ-K/CE8851-32CQ8DQ-P/CE8855-32CQ4BQ/CE8851-32CQ4BQ |
| For the CE6800 Series:  1. If the number of VLANs in the original packet is 0 and an untagged Layer 2 sub-interface is configured on the interface, after a physical interface receives a packet, the device uses the added VLAN ID to match the Layer 2 sub-interface configuration. If a match is found, the packet enters a BD through the Layer 2 sub-interface, and the inner packet carries the added VLAN ID. If no match is found, the packet is discarded.  2. If the number of VLANs in the original packet is 0 and a default Layer 2 sub-interface is configured on the interface, packets enter the BD through the Layer 2 sub-interface, and the inner packet carries the added VLAN ID.  3. If the number of VLANs in the original packet is 1 and a default Layer 2 sub-interface is configured on the interface, the packet enters the BD through the Layer 2 sub-interface, and the inner packet carries two VLAN tags (added VLAN tag and original VLAN tag).  4. If the number of VLANs in the original packet is 1 and a dot1q Layer 2 sub-interface is configured on the interface, after the physical interface receives the packet, the device uses the added VLAN ID to match the Layer 2 sub-interface configuration. If no match is found, the device uses the original VLAN ID to match the Layer 2 sub-interface configuration. If the packet matches a Layer 2 sub-interface, the packet enters the BD through the Layer 2 sub-interface, and the inner packet carries two VLAN tags (added VLAN tag and original VLAN tag).  5. If the number of VLANs in the original packet is 2 and a default Layer 2 sub-interface is configured on the interface, the packet enters the BD through the Layer 2 sub-interface, and the inner packet carries three VLAN tags (added VLAN tag and original VLAN tags).  6. If the number of VLANs in the original packet is 2 and a dot1q Layer 2 sub-interface is configured on the interface, after the physical interface receives the packet, the device uses the added VLAN ID to match the Layer 2 sub-interface configuration. If no match is found, the device uses the original VLAN ID to match the Layer 2 sub-interface configuration. If the packet matches a Layer 2 sub-interface, the packet enters the BD through the Layer 2 sub-interface, and the inner packet carries three VLAN tags (added VLAN tag and original VLAN tags).  7. If the number of VLANs in the original packet is 2 and a QinQ Layer 2 sub-interface is configured on the interface, after the physical interface receives the packet, the device uses the added VLAN ID to match the Layer 2 sub-interface configuration. If no match is found, the device uses the original VLAN ID to match the Layer 2 sub-interface configuration. If the packet matches a Layer 2 sub-interface, the packet enters the BD through the Layer 2 sub-interface, and the inner packet carries three VLAN tags (added VLAN tag and original VLAN tags). | CE6800 series | CE6863H-48S6CQ/CE6863H-48S6CQ-K/CE6881H-48S6CQ/CE6881H-48S6CQ-K/CE6881H-48T6CQ/CE6881H-48T6CQ-K |
| For the CE6800 Series:  When a traffic policy containing a traffic behavior of MQC-based VLAN mapping (replacing VLAN tags of packets) is applied to an interface and a Layer 2 sub-interface is configured on the interface, the traffic forwarding behavior on the interface is as follows:  1. If there is one VLAN in the original packet and a default Layer 2 sub-interface is configured on the interface: The packet enters the BD through the Layer 2 sub-interface, and the inner VLAN ID of the packet is the post-mapping VLAN ID.  2. If there is one VLAN in the original packet and a dot1q Layer 2 sub-interface is configured on the interface: After a physical interface receives a packet, the device uses the post-mapping VLAN ID to match the Layer 2 sub-interface configuration. If no match is found, the device uses the original VLAN ID of the packet to match the Layer 2 sub-interface configuration. If the packet matches a Layer 2 sub-interface, the packet enters the BD through the Layer 2 sub-interface, and the inner VLAN ID of the packet is the post-mapping VLAN ID.  3. If there are two VLANs in the original packet and a default Layer 2 sub-interface is configured on the interface: The packet enters the BD through the Layer 2 sub-interface, and the inner VLAN ID of the packet is the post-mapping VLAN ID.  4. If there are two VLANs in the original packet and a dot1q Layer 2 sub-interface is configured on the interface: After a physical interface receives a packet, the device uses the post-mapping VLAN ID to match the Layer 2 sub-interface configuration. If no match is found, the device uses the original VLAN ID of the packet to match the Layer 2 sub-interface configuration. If the packet matches a Layer 2 sub-interface, the packet enters the BD through the Layer 2 sub-interface, and the inner VLAN ID of the packet is the post-mapping VLAN ID.  5. If there are two VLANs in the original packet and a QinQ Layer 2 sub-interface is configured on the interface: After a physical interface receives a packet, the device uses the post-mapping VLAN ID to match the Layer 2 sub-interface configuration. If no match is found, the device uses the original VLAN ID of the packet to match the Layer 2 sub-interface configuration. If the packet matches a Layer 2 sub-interface, the packet enters the BD through the Layer 2 sub-interface, and the inner VLAN ID of the packet is the post-mapping VLAN ID. | CE6800 series | CE6863H-48S6CQ/CE6863H-48S6CQ-K/CE6881H-48S6CQ/CE6881H-48S6CQ-K/CE6881H-48T6CQ/CE6881H-48T6CQ-K |
| A VBDIF interface cannot be used as an outbound interface on the VXLAN underlay network side. | CE6800 series  CE8800 series | CE6855-48XS8CQ/CE6860-HAM/CE6860-SAN/CE6863H-48S6CQ/CE6863H-48S6CQ-K/CE6866-48S8CQ-K/CE6866-48S8CQ-P/CE6881H-48S6CQ/CE6881H-48S6CQ-K/CE6881H-48T6CQ/CE6881H-48T6CQ-K/CE6885-48YS8CQ/CE6863E-48S8CQ/CE6885-LL-56F (standard forwarding mode)/CE6885-48YS8CQ-T/CE6885-SAN-56F  CE8850-HAM/CE8850-SAN/CE8851-32CQ8DQ-K/CE8851-32CQ8DQ-P/CE8855-32CQ4BQ/CE8851-32CQ4BQ |
| The mapping between VXLAN tunnels and VNIs is not strictly checked. Packets can be forwarded as long as both VXLAN tunnels and VNIs exist. | CE6800 series  CE8800 series | CE6855-48XS8CQ/CE6860-HAM/CE6860-SAN/CE6863H-48S6CQ/CE6863H-48S6CQ-K/CE6866-48S8CQ-K/CE6866-48S8CQ-P/CE6881H-48S6CQ/CE6881H-48S6CQ-K/CE6881H-48T6CQ/CE6881H-48T6CQ-K/CE6885-48YS8CQ/CE6863E-48S8CQ/CE6885-LL-56F (standard forwarding mode)/CE6885-48YS8CQ-T/CE6885-SAN-56F  CE8850-HAM/CE8850-SAN/CE8851-32CQ8DQ-K/CE8851-32CQ8DQ-P/CE8855-32CQ4BQ/CE8851-32CQ4BQ |
| When a VXLAN tunnel has multiple paths, excess BUM packets may exist or some BUM packets may be discarded for a short period of time (less than 500 ms) during link failure recovery. | CE6800 series  CE8800 series | CE6855-48XS8CQ/CE6860-HAM/CE6860-SAN/CE6863H-48S6CQ/CE6863H-48S6CQ-K/CE6866-48S8CQ-K/CE6866-48S8CQ-P/CE6881H-48S6CQ/CE6881H-48S6CQ-K/CE6881H-48T6CQ/CE6881H-48T6CQ-K/CE6885-48YS8CQ/CE6863E-48S8CQ/CE6885-LL-56F (standard forwarding mode)/CE6885-48YS8CQ-T/CE6885-SAN-56F  CE8850-HAM/CE8850-SAN/CE8851-32CQ8DQ-K/CE8851-32CQ8DQ-P/CE8855-32CQ4BQ/CE8851-32CQ4BQ |
| If the destination address of a VXLAN tunnel is the default route, the VXLAN tunnel will not go up. | CE6800 series  CE8800 series | CE6855-48XS8CQ/CE6860-HAM/CE6860-SAN/CE6863H-48S6CQ/CE6863H-48S6CQ-K/CE6866-48S8CQ-K/CE6866-48S8CQ-P/CE6881H-48S6CQ/CE6881H-48S6CQ-K/CE6881H-48T6CQ/CE6881H-48T6CQ-K/CE6885-48YS8CQ/CE6863E-48S8CQ/CE6885-LL-56F (standard forwarding mode)/CE6885-48YS8CQ-T/CE6885-SAN-56F  CE8850-HAM/CE8850-SAN/CE8851-32CQ8DQ-K/CE8851-32CQ8DQ-P/CE8855-32CQ4BQ/CE8851-32CQ4BQ |
| On the centralized replicator, the tunnel whose source IP address is the source address of a non-NVE interface (that is, the tunnel whose source IP address is the vtep-src address in the BD or VPN view) does not support flood proxy. | CE6800 series  CE8800 series | CE6855-48XS8CQ/CE6860-HAM/CE6860-SAN/CE6863H-48S6CQ/CE6863H-48S6CQ-K/CE6866-48S8CQ-K/CE6866-48S8CQ-P/CE6881H-48S6CQ/CE6881H-48S6CQ-K/CE6881H-48T6CQ/CE6881H-48T6CQ-K/CE6885-48YS8CQ/CE6863E-48S8CQ/CE6885-LL-56F (standard forwarding mode)/CE6885-48YS8CQ-T/CE6885-SAN-56F  CE8850-HAM/CE8850-SAN/CE8851-32CQ8DQ-K/CE8851-32CQ8DQ-P/CE8855-32CQ4BQ/CE8851-32CQ4BQ |
| For the CE6800 Series:  When an upstream MQC rule is configured in the system view and a non-VXLAN profile is used, if the MQC rule cannot distinguish inner and outer information (for example, only protocol UDP is used as the match condition, but both inner and outer packets in a VXLAN multicast tunnel are UDP packets), the VXLAN multicast tunnel matches the rule twice during packet termination. If the action is redirection, it takes effect before multicast tunnel packets are terminated. (After redirection takes effect, multicast tunnel packets cannot be terminated.) | CE6800 series | CE6863H-48S6CQ/CE6863H-48S6CQ-K/CE6881H-48S6CQ/CE6881H-48S6CQ-K/CE6881H-48T6CQ/CE6881H-48T6CQ-K |
| For the CE6800 Series:  After receiving a VXLAN packet, the device decapsulates the packet as long as the VXLAN tunnel corresponding to the outer IP address can be found, without checking whether the outer destination MAC address is the gateway MAC address. | CE6800 series | CE6863H-48S6CQ/CE6863H-48S6CQ-K/CE6881H-48S6CQ/CE6881H-48S6CQ-K/CE6881H-48T6CQ/CE6881H-48T6CQ-K |
| For the CE6800 Series:  The BUM traffic load balancing function of VXLAN tunnels must ensure that the ECMP paths delivered by each chip are the same. This function cannot be used together with preferential forwarding of the local chip. | CE6800 series | CE6863H-48S6CQ/CE6863H-48S6CQ-K/CE6881H-48S6CQ/CE6881H-48S6CQ-K/CE6881H-48T6CQ/CE6881H-48T6CQ-K |
| For the CE6800 Series:  BUM traffic load balancing over VXLAN tunnels cannot be used together with IGMP snooping over VXLAN or IP multicast over VXLAN. | CE6800 series | CE6863H-48S6CQ/CE6863H-48S6CQ-K/CE6881H-48S6CQ/CE6881H-48S6CQ-K/CE6881H-48T6CQ/CE6881H-48T6CQ-K |
| For the CE6800 Series:  In a VXLAN EVPN scenario, if a server or switch is connected to a CloudEngine switch in active/standby mode, and dynamic MAC address entries that do not match traffic between boards are aged out and EVPN MAC address entries are withdrawn on the remote end, when dynamic MAC address entries on boards are updated, EVPN MAC address entries are flooded, and ARP probe is triggered. To prevent ARP probe caused by multiple aging of MAC address entries in this scenario, you are advised to set the aging time of dynamic MAC address entries to a value greater than 1200s. | CE6800 series | CE6820H-48S6CQ/CE6820S-48S6CQ/CE6820H-48S6CQ-K/CE6863H-48S6CQ/CE6863H-48S6CQ-K/CE6881H-48S6CQ/CE6881H-48S6CQ-K |
| ECMP load balancing cannot be performed for BUM packets entering a VXLAN tunnel. Because an outbound interface of the VXLAN tunnel is selected to join a multicast group, ECMP load balancing cannot be performed for BUM packets after the packets enter the VXLAN tunnel. | CE6800 series  CE8800 series | CE6855-48XS8CQ/CE6860-HAM/CE6860-SAN/CE6866-48S8CQ-K/CE6866-48S8CQ-P/CE6885-48YS8CQ/CE6863E-48S8CQ/CE6885-LL-56F (standard forwarding mode)/CE6885-48YS8CQ-T/CE6885-SAN-56F  CE8850-HAM/CE8850-SAN/CE8851-32CQ8DQ-K/CE8851-32CQ8DQ-P/CE8855-32CQ4BQ/CE8851-32CQ4BQ |
| 1. When a dot1q sub-interface receives ARP packets with more than one tag, the sub-interface discards the ARP packets. As a result, broadcast packets cannot be converted into unicast packets.  2. When a QinQ Layer 2 sub-interface is bound to a BD, ARP broadcast suppression cannot be performed in the BD. When a QinQ Layer 2 sub-interface is bound to a BD and the rewrite pop double command is run, ARP broadcast suppression can be performed properly.  3. When a QinQ Layer 2 sub-interface is bound to a BD and the rewrite pop double command is run on the sub-interface, the problem mentioned in the first point also occurs in packets with more than two tags. | CE6800 series  CE8800 series | CE6820H-48S6CQ/CE6820S-48S6CQ/CE6820H-48S6CQ-K/CE6855-48XS8CQ/CE6860-HAM/CE6860-SAN/CE6863H-48S6CQ/CE6863H-48S6CQ-K/CE6866-48S8CQ-K/CE6866-48S8CQ-P/CE6881H-48S6CQ/CE6881H-48S6CQ-K/CE6881H-48T6CQ/CE6881H-48T6CQ-K/CE6885-48YS8CQ/CE6863E-48S8CQ/CE6885-LL-56F (standard forwarding mode)/CE6885-48YS8CQ-T/CE6885-SAN-56F  CE8850-HAM/CE8850-SAN/CE8851-32CQ8DQ-K/CE8851-32CQ8DQ-P/CE8855-32CQ4BQ/CE8851-32CQ4BQ |

| 1. VXLAN ping packets need to be scheduled by the FWM thread. Due to the scheduling of the FWM thread, the ping delay may be too long, causing packet loss due to timeout.  2. If IPv4/IPv6 UDP packets are used to respond to packets, packets are sent in UDP queues. If the queue is congested, the ping delay is too long, causing packet loss due to timeout.  3. By default, VXLAN ping uses the source IP address of the underlay Layer 3 interface. If there is no route to the peer end (for example, in indirect connection scenarios), you are advised to use the -a parameter to specify the source IP address of the tunnel.  4. The vni parameter in VXLAN ping and VXLAN tracert does not support Layer 3 VNIs, that is, VNIs bound to VPN instances. If Layer 3 VNIs are used, VXLAN ping and VXLAN tracert fail.  5. The VNI parameter in VXLAN ping and tracert commands does not support inter-DC mapping VNIs, that is, VNIs of non-default split horizon groups. If the mapping VNI is used, VXLAN ping and tracert fail. This restriction exists in versions earlier than V300R023C00.  6. In an M-LAG dual-active access scenario, two devices have the same tunnel source IP address. As a result, reply packets are forwarded to a non-initiator device, causing ping failures. To solve this problem, use the -a parameter to specify the source IP address as the unique IP address of the initiator device.  7. In an M-LAG dual-active access scenario, the tunnel source IP addresses of the two devices are the same. As a result, error packets are forwarded to the non-initiator device, and the tracert node is not displayed. | CE6800 series  CE8800 series | CE6855-48XS8CQ/CE6860-HAM/CE6860-SAN/CE6863H-48S6CQ/CE6863H-48S6CQ-K/CE6866-48S8CQ-K/CE6866-48S8CQ-P/CE6881H-48S6CQ/CE6881H-48S6CQ-K/CE6881H-48T6CQ/CE6881H-48T6CQ-K/CE6885-48YS8CQ/CE6863E-48S8CQ/CE6885-LL-56F (standard forwarding mode)/CE6885-48YS8CQ-T/CE6885-SAN-56F  CE8850-HAM/CE8850-SAN/CE8851-32CQ8DQ-K/CE8851-32CQ8DQ-P/CE8855-32CQ4BQ/CE8851-32CQ4BQ |

In a telco cloud symmetric forwarding scenario, if IPv6 services are used, dynamic routing protocols cannot be deployed between VNFs and TOR switches. | CE6800 series  CE8800 series | CE6820H-48S6CQ/CE6820S-48S6CQ/CE6820H-48S6CQ-K/CE6855-48XS8CQ/CE6860-HAM/CE6860-SAN/CE6863H-48S6CQ/CE6863H-48S6CQ-K/CE6866-48S8CQ-K/CE6866-48S8CQ-P/CE6881H-48S6CQ/CE6881H-48S6CQ-K/CE6881H-48T6CQ/CE6881H-48T6CQ-K/CE6885-48YS8CQ/CE6863E-48S8CQ/CE6885-LL-56F (standard forwarding mode)/CE6885-48YS8CQ-T/CE6885-LL-56F (low latency mode)/CE6885-SAN-56F  CE8850-HAM/CE8850-SAN/CE8851-32CQ8DQ-K/CE8851-32CQ8DQ-P/CE8855-32CQ4BQ/CE8851-32CQ4BQ |
