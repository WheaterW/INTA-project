Configuring ETS

#### Context

ETS provides flexible, hierarchical scheduling management to prevent interference and conflicts between services after network convergence.

The CE6885-LL (low latency mode) does not support the ETS function.



#### Prerequisites

Before configuring ETS, you have completed the following tasks:

* Configure a link layer protocol so that interfaces at both ends of a link are up.
* Configure priority mapping to map packet priorities to per-hop behaviors (PHBs)/colors.
