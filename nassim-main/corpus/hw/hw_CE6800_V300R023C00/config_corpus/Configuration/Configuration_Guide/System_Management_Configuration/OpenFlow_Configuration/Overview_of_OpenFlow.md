Overview of OpenFlow

#### Definition

OpenFlow is a communication protocol between the control and forwarding planes in a software-defined networking (SDN) architecture. It provides standard and open interfaces to separate the control and forwarding planes. OpenFlow also allows the controller to access and operate the forwarding plane of network devices, which may be physical or virtual.


#### Purpose

With the fast growth of server virtualization on physical networks, the increasing number of virtual machines complicates network management and slows down service provisioning. To cope with these problems, network devices must be easy-to-operate, provide high scalability, and support centralized control and management of forwarding behaviors. However, traditional network devices integrate the control and forwarding planes. Therefore, they have poor scalability, and technology update takes a long time. In addition, it is difficult to centrally control and manage devices or quickly provision services. SDN separates the control and forwarding planes. As a communication protocol in the SDN architecture, OpenFlow enables communication between the control and forwarding planes so that the network-wide forwarding services can be centrally controlled and managed and fast service provisioning can be implemented.
