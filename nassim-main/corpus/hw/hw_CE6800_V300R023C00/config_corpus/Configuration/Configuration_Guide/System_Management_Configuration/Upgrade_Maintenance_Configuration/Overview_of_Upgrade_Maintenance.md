Overview of Upgrade Maintenance

#### Definition

Upgrade maintenance refers to operations performed to upgrade or maintain a device. It includes upgrading the basic software package, installing and upgrading a feature software package or an independent-hardware-release package, installing a patch, and installing a module.


#### Purpose

If faults or errors occur in the software running on a device, you need to rectify them by modifying the software. And if the user environment changes, or you want to add new features or optimize the device performance or functions to meet new user requirements, you need to partially update the original device software. Such operations are all implemented through upgrade maintenance.

Upgrade maintenance enables a device to meet users' service requirements, improve device reliability, optimize device performance, and ensure robust device operation on the live network.
