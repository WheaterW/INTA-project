Overview of OAS

#### Definition

The Open Application System (OAS) enables devices to open their systems through the virtualization technology. It allows users to easily and quickly install, run, and manage third-party applications on devices. Currently, containers are used to open a device system.


#### Purpose

With the continuous development of networks, users have increasing requirements for differentiated network devices. The inherent functions of traditional network devices cannot meet user requirements. The OAS uses the virtualization technology to provide a platform for users. Users can use their own tools to develop and install applications and deploy customized functions on existing devices to meet diversified network management requirements.


#### Benefits

* The OAS provides a virtualization platform architecture to allow users to flexibly expand services based on their requirements.
* You can add new applications to existing devices without deploying additional servers, reducing management costs.
* The OAS uses the virtualization technology to provide isolated running space for third-party applications, ensuring device performance and security.
