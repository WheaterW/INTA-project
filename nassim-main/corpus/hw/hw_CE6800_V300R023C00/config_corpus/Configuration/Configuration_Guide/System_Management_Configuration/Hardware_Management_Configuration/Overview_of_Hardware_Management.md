Overview of Hardware Management

#### Definition

Hardware management is a feature designed to reduce the device failure rate and ensure secure, stable, and reliable system operations.


#### Purpose

Ensuring that a device runs stably requires proper network planning and routine device management and maintenance. In terms of hardware management, operations include device/board reset, board power-on/power-off, board replacement, optical module management, fan speed adjustment, and power control, as well as management of the device/board temperature, voltage, current, CPU, and memory. This feature monitors the hardware status in real time so that the system can report an alarm as soon as an exception occurs. You can then check alarm information and take corresponding measures to ensure that the system runs securely, stably, and reliably.
