Overview of RMON

#### Definition

Remote Network Monitoring (RMON) is a widely used standard defined by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) for monitoring large-scale networks. It enables network administrators to monitor data traffic on a network segment or an entire network and is an enhancement of the Management Information Base II (MIB II) specification.


#### Purpose

As networks become more and more distributed, the IETF developed RMON to address the limitations of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP). It improves the availability of management information, lightens the burden on the Network Management Station (NMS), and enables network administrators to monitor multiple network segments.

With RMON, administrators can monitor remote network devices more efficiently and proactively through SNMP. In addition, RMON provides a highly efficient solution to monitor sub-networks. It decreases the volume of traffic between the NMS and agents and facilitates large-size network management.


#### Benefits

RMON provides an efficient method for monitoring networks and brings the following benefits:

* Expanded monitoring range: RMON MIBs expand the range of network management to the data link layer, enabling administrators to monitor networks more effectively.
* Offline operation: RMON Agent can continuously collect error, performance, and configuration data even when the administrator is not querying network statuses. RMON provides a solution for analyzing the traffic in a specific range without consuming bandwidth resources.
* Data analysis: RMON Agent analyzes network problems and resource consumption, providing information to diagnose faults and reducing the overall workload of the NMS.
