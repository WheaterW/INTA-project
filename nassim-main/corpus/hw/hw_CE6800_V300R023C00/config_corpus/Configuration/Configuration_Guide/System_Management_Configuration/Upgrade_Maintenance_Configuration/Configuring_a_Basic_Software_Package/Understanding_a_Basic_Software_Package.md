Understanding a Basic Software Package
======================================

A basic software package ensures the running of components and services by providing hardware drivers, common components, an operating system, a boot file, etc. This package is the basis for the running of feature software packages (components and services), independent-hardware-release packages, patches, and modules, supporting an entire device. You can maintain and manage a basic software package separately. A basic software package can be installed only during device startup and can be upgraded. It cannot be installed or uninstalled on an in-service device.

#### Installing a Basic Software Package

When a device is started for the first time, you can install a basic software package through the BIOS user interface. After the basic system is started, you can use corresponding commands to configure service parameters.

When the device is restarted, the system automatically installs the specified next-startup basic software package. Generally, this mode is used when a device is upgraded.


#### Upgrading a Basic Software Package

Huawei releases new versions of a basic software package to support new features or functions, optimize performance, or solve problems in the current version. An upgrade of the basic software package running on a device need to be performed based on user requirements or Huawei's version incorporation requirements. In this case, you need to configure the basic software package of a later version that takes effect at the next startup and then restart the device.

Device upgrades are closely related to newly released versions. Each new version comes with a corresponding upgrade guide, which provides instructions for performing an upgrade.
