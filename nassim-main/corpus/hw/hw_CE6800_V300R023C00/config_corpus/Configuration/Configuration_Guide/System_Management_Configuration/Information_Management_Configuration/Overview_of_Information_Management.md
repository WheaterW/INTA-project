Overview of Information Management

#### Definition

The information management (IM) module operates as the information hub of a device. IM receives logs, traps, debugging messages, and other device-generated information to implement unified management and flexible output.


#### Purpose

Immediate and accurate information about device operation facilitates troubleshooting if an exception or fault occurs on a device. During device operation, IM records relevant information generated by each module, including logs, traps, and debugging messages. By configuring IM to classify or filter such information based on information type and severity, you can obtain required information through the console, user terminal, and log host, or other medium as required. This enables you to easily monitor the device status and locate faults.
