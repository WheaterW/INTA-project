Logging In to the Server Using the NMS

#### Context

After the preceding configuration is complete, you can log in to the server from the client using the NMS. This allows you to remotely configure devices.

The NMS can manage devices only after it has established a connection and can communicate with them.

Before deploying NEs, divide the network into subnets as required. The physical topology must be easy for routine maintenance in addition to showing the actual network structure.

If the Huawei NMS is used, creating NEs will consume specific upgrade licenses or NE resource licenses. If there are no remaining NE resources or specific upgrade licenses, the system displays a message indicating that it cannot create additional NEs. In this case, apply for NE resources or specific upgrade licenses.

For installation and maintenance of the NMS, see the relevant installation instruction and usage guidelines.
