Overview of OPS

#### Definition

The open programmability system (OPS) is an open platform that provides representational state transfer (RESTful) application programming interfaces (APIs) to achieve programmability, allowing third-party applications to run on the platform.


#### Purpose

Conventional network devices provide only limited functions and predefined services. As networks develop, the static and inflexible service provisioning mode cannot meet the requirements for diversified and differentiated services. Some customers require devices with specific openness so that they can develop their own functions and deploy proprietary management policies to implement automatic management and maintenance, lowering management costs.

To meet the preceding requirements, the OPS is offered by Huawei. The OPS, an open platform with programmability, allows users and third-party developers to develop and deploy network management policies using open RESTful APIs. Through programmability, the OPS implements rapid service expansion, automatic function deployment, and intelligent device management, helping reduce network operation and maintenance costs and simplify network operations.


#### Benefits

* The OPS supports user-defined configurations and applications, enhancing the flexibility in service deployment and network device management.
* The OPS supports various third-party applications, improving network utilization.
* The OPS allows users to develop private services.
* The OPS achieves flexible application deployment.

#### Security

The OPS provides the following security measures:

* API security
  
  Only authorized users can operate the OPS. Authentication and authorization are implemented based on roles and permissions.
* Operation security
  
  Resources are isolated by module in the OPS and their usage can be monitored.
* Program security
  
  Third-party resources are used to manage programs.
* Important information security
  
  OPS APIs use a secure communication protocol to prevent information leakage during transmission. However, local data and operation security needs to be assured by users.
