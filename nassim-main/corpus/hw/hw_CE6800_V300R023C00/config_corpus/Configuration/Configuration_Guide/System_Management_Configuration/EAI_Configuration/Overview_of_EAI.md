Overview of EAI

#### Definition

Embedded Artificial Intelligence (EAI) provides common model management, data obtaining, and preprocessing functions for intelligent algorithm-based functions on devices, and sends the results of inference to AI functions. It is a built-in general framework system for AI functions.


#### Purpose

The fourth industrial revolution, led by AI, has arrived. AI is profoundly changing human life and the world at an unprecedented speed. Its three core elements are algorithm, computing power, and data. If each AI function supported by a device maintains these three elements, the intelligent algorithm-based functions require the device to provide a large amount of sample data and a high-performance computing capability, which severely affects the normal running of the device.

To address this issue, the EAI system provides a complete universal framework for these AI functions and enables the AI functions supported by devices to subscribe to services of the EAI system. After an AI function subscribes to services of the EAI system, the system performs inference on the large amount of data related to the AI function using the intelligent algorithm to enable the AI function to be implemented based on the inference result.
