Overview of Performance Management

#### Definition

The performance management (PM) function periodically collects statistics about various system performance indicators, helping you query and analyze current or historical performance statistics.


#### Purpose

PM provides current and historical system performance data, becoming a key feature for improving device operation and maintenance (O&M) capabilities. You can use this data to analyze the system's running status, locate faults, and perform system configuration.

You can also analyze system performance trends based on collected performance data. For example, by analyzing the peak and valley values of user traffic during a specific day, you can predict the network's traffic growth and speed for at least the next 30 days. More important, system performance data forms the foundation for network configuration optimization and network expansion.
