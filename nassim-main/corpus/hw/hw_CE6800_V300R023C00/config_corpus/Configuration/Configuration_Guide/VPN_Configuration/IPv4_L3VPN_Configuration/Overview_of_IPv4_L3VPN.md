Overview of IPv4 L3VPN

#### Definition

Virtual private network (VPN) technology is used to establish private networks over a public network. The reason why a VPN is called a virtual network is that a connection between any two nodes within an entire VPN network does not require an E2E physical link, which is required by a traditional private network. A VPN network is built over a network platform provided by a public network service provider.


#### Purpose

The expansion of the network scale boosts the internal interconnection requirements of enterprises. Initially, Internet service providers (ISPs) provide services for enterprises through leased lines. This mode has many shortcomings, such as lengthy construction, high costs, management difficulties, and poor security.

VPN is developed to solve the preceding problems. VPN has the following characteristics:

* Private: It provides the same private network experience as a traditional private network. Resources between the VPN and the underlying transport network are independent, that is, VPN resources cannot be consumed by users who do not belong to the VPN. In addition, the VPN security can be fully guaranteed to protect internal information of the VPN from external interference.
* Virtual: Users in a VPN communicate with each other over a public network, which can also be used by non-VPN users. A VPN is only a logical private network. A public network that carries a VPN is called a VPN backbone network.

#### Benefits

VPN brings the following benefits:

* Reduces enterprise interconnection costs and improves enterprise interconnection flexibility.
* Supports overlapping address spaces, which solves the problem of IP address shortage and facilitates network planning.
* Isolates data forwarding between VPN instances, improving security.
