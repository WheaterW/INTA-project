Overview of GRE

#### Definition

Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE) is a tunneling protocol that encapsulates the packets of a wide variety of network layer protocols, such as Internetwork Packet Exchange (IPX) and AppleTalk, inside IP tunneling packets. These packets can then be transmitted over an IPv4 network.

GRE provides a mechanism for transporting the packets of one protocol over another protocol by means of encapsulation, enabling packets to be transmitted over heterogeneous networks. The channel used for transmitting these packets is called a tunnel.


#### Purpose

GRE was introduced to enable data transmission over heterogeneous networks, and achieves this by transmitting the packets of a wide variety of network layer protocols, such as IPX and AppleTalk, over an IPv4 network.

GRE also serves as a Layer 3 tunneling protocol of Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), and provides a tunnel for transparently transmitting VPN packets.


#### Benefits

GRE offers the following benefits:

* Enables packets to be transmitted between networks running different protocols using a single network protocol.
* Enlarges the scope of a hop-limited network.
* Connects discontiguous subnets for VPN setup.
