Overview of IPv4 Static Routes

#### Definition

A static route is a manually configured route that allows network traffic to reach a specified destination.


#### Purpose

Static routes alone can implement interworking for simple networks. Static routes can also be used if devices cannot use dynamic routing protocols or do not have available routes to destination networks.

Static routes can accurately control route selection on a network. Properly configuring and using static routes can improve network performance and guarantee the required bandwidth for important applications.
