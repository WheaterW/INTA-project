| If inner packets are VXLAN packets, load balancing is performed only based on IP packets, and the inner packets cannot have more than two tags.  By default, the hash algorithm is performed based on inner packets. Only load balancing based on IP packets is performed. For non-IP packets (such as MAC-IN-MAC packets), the IP-related fields in the hash template are set to 0 for hash calculation.  For MAC-IN-MAC packets, the user MAC address cannot be identified and the hash algorithm cannot be performed based on the user MAC address. In addition, the inner packets with more than two tags cannot be parsed and therefore the hash algorithm cannot be performed. | CE6800 series  CE8800 series | CE6855-48XS8CQ/CE6860-HAM/CE6860-SAN/CE6863H-48S6CQ/CE6863H-48S6CQ-K/CE6866-48S8CQ-K/CE6866-48S8CQ-P/CE6881H-48S6CQ/CE6881H-48S6CQ-K/CE6881H-48T6CQ/CE6881H-48T6CQ-K/CE6885-48YS8CQ/CE6863E-48S8CQ/CE6885-LL-56F (standard forwarding mode)/CE6885-48YS8CQ-T/CE6885-SAN-56F  CE8850-HAM/CE8850-SAN/CE8851-32CQ8DQ-K/CE8851-32CQ8DQ-P/CE8855-32CQ4BQ/CE8851-32CQ4BQ |
| In ECMP networking, when IP/IPv6 link flapping occurs (for example, multiple interfaces are Down), a large number of ECMP member links converge and apply for new ECMP/NHP resources. As a result, a resource alarm is triggered during link flapping. In addition, when ECMP/NHP resources occupied by multiple intermediate states are insufficient, the ECMP/NHP resources are immediately released and applied for by new ECMP member relationships. As a result, routes that use these intermediate states for forwarding are interrupted for a long time. If ECMP resources fail to be applied for or the chip fails to deliver ECMP resources, the ECMP resources are processed as a single hop. | CE6800 series  CE8800 series | CE6820H-48S6CQ/CE6820S-48S6CQ/CE6820H-48S6CQ-K/CE6855-48XS8CQ/CE6860-HAM/CE6860-SAN/CE6863H-48S6CQ/CE6863H-48S6CQ-K/CE6866-48S8CQ-K/CE6866-48S8CQ-P/CE6881H-48S6CQ/CE6881H-48S6CQ-K/CE6881H-48T6CQ/CE6881H-48T6CQ-K/CE6885-48YS8CQ/CE6863E-48S8CQ/CE6885-LL-56F (standard forwarding mode)/CE6885-48YS8CQ-T/CE6885-LL-56F (low latency mode)/CE6885-SAN-56F  CE8850-HAM/CE8850-SAN/CE8851-32CQ8DQ-K/CE8851-32CQ8DQ-P/CE8855-32CQ4BQ/CE8851-32CQ4BQ |
| 1. Indirect next hop takes effect only when a single peer is selected for BGP routes.  2. After indirect next hop is enabled, routes that are recursed to a combination of next hops (single next hop or ECMP) occupy ECMP resources. As a result, ECMP resource consumption increases.  3. Indirect next hop is not supported in default route and FRR scenarios. | CE6800 series  CE8800 series | CE6855-48XS8CQ/CE6885-48YS8CQ/CE6863E-48S8CQ/CE6885-LL-56F (standard forwarding mode)/CE6885-48YS8CQ-T/CE6885-LL-56F (low latency mode)/CE6885-SAN-56F  CE8855-32CQ4BQ/CE8851-32CQ4BQ |
| After ECMP load balancing consistency is enabled, the number of member paths on the forwarding plane increases. As a result, the ECMP fast update performance deteriorates.  Switchover:  1. If a single interface is faulty and the interface on the local board is shut down, the switching takes less than 100 ms. The switching performance is irrelevant to the number of route prefixes.  2. Board fault: A single ECMP member port goes Down due to a board fault, the switching takes less than 600 ms. The switching performance is irrelevant to the number of route prefixes.  3. If multiple interfaces are faulty and 10K (K = 1024) routes exist, the average convergence time of each interface is 500 ms.  If the number of routes is less than 10K (K = 1024), the performance is the same as that when 10K (K = 1024) routes exist. If the number of routes is greater than 10K (K = 1024), the performance is in direct proportion to the number of routes.  Switchback:  1. No packet loss occurs on dynamic routes.  2. Static route switchback requires traffic to trigger ARP learning, which may cause packet loss.  Description:  1. After ECMP load balancing consistency is enabled, the convergence performance of the preceding link faults deteriorates. The convergence performance needs to be increased by 100 ms.  2. When a 100GE link is used as a member path for consistent hash forwarding and a single 100GE interface fails, the switchover time is less than 600 ms. | CE6800 series  CE8800 series | CE6820H-48S6CQ/CE6820S-48S6CQ/CE6820H-48S6CQ-K/CE6855-48XS8CQ/CE6860-HAM/CE6860-SAN/CE6863H-48S6CQ/CE6863H-48S6CQ-K/CE6866-48S8CQ-K/CE6866-48S8CQ-P/CE6881H-48S6CQ/CE6881H-48S6CQ-K/CE6881H-48T6CQ/CE6881H-48T6CQ-K/CE6885-48YS8CQ/CE6863E-48S8CQ/CE6885-LL-56F (standard forwarding mode)/CE6885-48YS8CQ-T/CE6885-LL-56F (low latency mode)/CE6885-SAN-56F  CE8850-HAM/CE8850-SAN/CE8851-32CQ8DQ-K/CE8851-32CQ8DQ-P/CE8855-32CQ4BQ/CE8851-32CQ4BQ |
| ECMP load balancing consistency does not take effect in asymmetric route deployment scenarios. Different routes must use the same or different ECMP group members. Some member paths cannot overlap. That is, a link cannot be a member of both ECMP1 and ECMP2, ECMP1 and ECMP2 have different member links. | CE6800 series  CE8800 series | CE6820H-48S6CQ/CE6820S-48S6CQ/CE6820H-48S6CQ-K/CE6855-48XS8CQ/CE6860-HAM/CE6860-SAN/CE6863H-48S6CQ/CE6863H-48S6CQ-K/CE6866-48S8CQ-K/CE6866-48S8CQ-P/CE6881H-48S6CQ/CE6881H-48S6CQ-K/CE6881H-48T6CQ/CE6881H-48T6CQ-K/CE6885-48YS8CQ/CE6863E-48S8CQ/CE6885-LL-56F (standard forwarding mode)/CE6885-48YS8CQ-T/CE6885-LL-56F (low latency mode)/CE6885-SAN-56F  CE8850-HAM/CE8850-SAN/CE8851-32CQ8DQ-K/CE8851-32CQ8DQ-P/CE8855-32CQ4BQ/CE8851-32CQ4BQ |
| When the outbound interface of an ECMP member link alternates between Up and Down, ECMP fast update can detect the interface flapping and hash the traffic on the interface to other links. When the interface goes Up, the traffic is switched back; however, ECMP convergence on the control plane does not detect intermittent disconnections. Therefore, when an interface alternates between Up and Down states, ECMP hash consistency cannot be ensured. | CE6800 series  CE8800 series | CE6820H-48S6CQ/CE6820S-48S6CQ/CE6820H-48S6CQ-K/CE6855-48XS8CQ/CE6860-HAM/CE6860-SAN/CE6863H-48S6CQ/CE6863H-48S6CQ-K/CE6866-48S8CQ-K/CE6866-48S8CQ-P/CE6881H-48S6CQ/CE6881H-48S6CQ-K/CE6881H-48T6CQ/CE6881H-48T6CQ-K/CE6885-48YS8CQ/CE6863E-48S8CQ/CE6885-LL-56F (standard forwarding mode)/CE6885-48YS8CQ-T/CE6885-LL-56F (low latency mode)/CE6885-SAN-56F  CE8850-HAM/CE8850-SAN/CE8851-32CQ8DQ-K/CE8851-32CQ8DQ-P/CE8855-32CQ4BQ/CE8851-32CQ4BQ |
| After ECMP consistency hash is enabled, the FIB entry delivery rate decreases by about 10%. | CE6800 series  CE8800 series | CE6820H-48S6CQ/CE6820S-48S6CQ/CE6820H-48S6CQ-K/CE6855-48XS8CQ/CE6860-HAM/CE6860-SAN/CE6863H-48S6CQ/CE6863H-48S6CQ-K/CE6866-48S8CQ-K/CE6866-48S8CQ-P/CE6881H-48S6CQ/CE6881H-48S6CQ-K/CE6881H-48T6CQ/CE6881H-48T6CQ-K/CE6885-48YS8CQ/CE6863E-48S8CQ/CE6885-LL-56F (standard forwarding mode)/CE6885-48YS8CQ-T/CE6885-LL-56F (low latency mode)/CE6885-SAN-56F  CE8850-HAM/CE8850-SAN/CE8851-32CQ8DQ-K/CE8851-32CQ8DQ-P/CE8855-32CQ4BQ/CE8851-32CQ4BQ |
| After ECMP load balancing consistency is enabled, the next-hop resource consumption of member paths increases. The number of members in each ECMP group is fixed to 128. Therefore, the number of ECMP groups decreases. The number of ECMP groups depends on the total number of ECMP paths on a board. Some boards may successfully apply for 128-channel NHP resources, but some boards may fail to apply for 128-channel NHP resources. If these boards fail to apply for 128-channel NHP resources, they apply for NHP resources in common mode.  For example, if the total number of ECMP path members on a card is 128K, the maximum number of ECMP groups after hash consistency is enabled is 1K (128K/128 = 1K). (128K is shared by all services, and K = 1024.) | CE6800 series  CE8800 series | CE6820H-48S6CQ/CE6820S-48S6CQ/CE6820H-48S6CQ-K/CE6855-48XS8CQ/CE6860-HAM/CE6860-SAN/CE6863H-48S6CQ/CE6863H-48S6CQ-K/CE6866-48S8CQ-K/CE6866-48S8CQ-P/CE6881H-48S6CQ/CE6881H-48S6CQ-K/CE6881H-48T6CQ/CE6881H-48T6CQ-K/CE6885-48YS8CQ/CE6863E-48S8CQ/CE6885-LL-56F (standard forwarding mode)/CE6885-48YS8CQ-T/CE6885-LL-56F (low latency mode)/CE6885-SAN-56F  CE8850-HAM/CE8850-SAN/CE8851-32CQ8DQ-K/CE8851-32CQ8DQ-P/CE8855-32CQ4BQ/CE8851-32CQ4BQ |

| 1. For common IPv4 fragmented packets, when 5-tuple load balancing is performed for TCP/UDP packets, the first packet of fragmented packets is automatically load balanced based on only source and destination IP addresses.  2. For GRE/IP tunnel-encapsulated outer IP-based fragmented packets, the inner IP/IPv6 header of the first fragmented packet can participate in hash load balancing. As a result, the hash route selection of the first fragmented packet is different from that of subsequent fragmented packets. | CE6800 series  CE8800 series | CE6820H-48S6CQ/CE6820S-48S6CQ/CE6820H-48S6CQ-K/CE6855-48XS8CQ/CE6860-HAM/CE6860-SAN/CE6863H-48S6CQ/CE6863H-48S6CQ-K/CE6866-48S8CQ-K/CE6866-48S8CQ-P/CE6881H-48S6CQ/CE6881H-48S6CQ-K/CE6881H-48T6CQ/CE6881H-48T6CQ-K/CE6885-48YS8CQ/CE6863E-48S8CQ/CE6885-LL-56F (standard forwarding mode)/CE6885-48YS8CQ-T/CE6885-LL-56F (low latency mode)/CE6885-SAN-56F  CE8850-HAM/CE8850-SAN/CE8851-32CQ8DQ-K/CE8851-32CQ8DQ-P/CE8855-32CQ4BQ/CE8851-32CQ4BQ |

| Default routes and common routes share IPv6 forwarding entries. When the number of common routes exceeds the upper limit, the default routes that are delivered later fail to be delivered. | CE6800 series  CE8800 series | CE6820H-48S6CQ/CE6820S-48S6CQ/CE6820H-48S6CQ-K/CE6855-48XS8CQ/CE6860-HAM/CE6860-SAN/CE6863H-48S6CQ/CE6863H-48S6CQ-K/CE6866-48S8CQ-K/CE6866-48S8CQ-P/CE6881H-48S6CQ/CE6881H-48S6CQ-K/CE6881H-48T6CQ/CE6881H-48T6CQ-K/CE6885-48YS8CQ/CE6863E-48S8CQ/CE6885-LL-56F (standard forwarding mode)/CE6885-48YS8CQ-T/CE6885-SAN-56F  CE8850-HAM/CE8850-SAN/CE8851-32CQ8DQ-K/CE8851-32CQ8DQ-P/CE8855-32CQ4BQ/CE8851-32CQ4BQ |
| 1. The indirect next hop function takes effect only when BGP4+ routes select a single peer, but does not take effect when BGP4+ routes have multiple next hops.  2. After indirect next hop is enabled, FIB6 routes that are recursed to a combination of next hops (single next hop or ECMP) occupy ECMP resources. As a result, ECMP resource consumption increases.  3. Indirect next hop is not supported in default route and FRR scenarios. | CE6800 series  CE8800 series | CE6855-48XS8CQ/CE6885-48YS8CQ/CE6863E-48S8CQ/CE6885-LL-56F (standard forwarding mode)/CE6885-48YS8CQ-T/CE6885-LL-56F (low latency mode)/CE6885-SAN-56F  CE8855-32CQ4BQ/CE8851-32CQ4BQ |
