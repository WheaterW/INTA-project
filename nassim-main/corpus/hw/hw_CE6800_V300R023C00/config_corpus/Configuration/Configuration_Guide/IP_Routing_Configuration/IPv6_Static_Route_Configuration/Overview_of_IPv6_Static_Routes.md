Overview of IPv6 Static Routes

#### Definition

A static route is a manually configured route that allows network traffic to reach a specified destination.


#### Purpose

Static routes alone can implement interworking for simple networks. If a device cannot use dynamic routing protocols for network connectivity, static routes can be configured on the device.

Static routes can be used to precisely control route selection on a network. Properly configuring and using static routes can improve network performance and guarantee the required bandwidth for important applications.
