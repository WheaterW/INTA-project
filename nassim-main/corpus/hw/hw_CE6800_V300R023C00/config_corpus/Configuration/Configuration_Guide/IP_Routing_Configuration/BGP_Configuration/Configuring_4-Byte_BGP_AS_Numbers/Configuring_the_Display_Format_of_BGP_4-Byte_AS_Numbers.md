Configuring the Display Format of BGP 4-Byte AS Numbers
=======================================================

Configuring the Display Format of BGP 4-Byte AS Numbers

#### Context

By default, a BGP 4-byte AS number is displayed in dotted notation. If you prefer 4-byte AS numbers in integer format, perform this configuration task to change the display format of 4-byte AS numbers from dotted notation to integer.

![](public_sys-resources/notice_3.0-en-us.png) Changing the format of 4-byte AS numbers will affect matching results of AS\_Path regular expressions and extended community attribute filters. Therefore, if the system is using an AS\_Path regular expression or an extended community attribute filter as an import or export policy, you must reconfigure the AS\_Path regular expression using the [**ip as-path-filter**](cmdqueryname=ip+as-path-filter) command or the extended community attribute filter using the [**ip extcommunity-filter**](cmdqueryname=ip+extcommunity-filter) or [**ip extcommunity-list soo**](cmdqueryname=ip+extcommunity-list+soo) command after changing the format of 4-byte AS numbers. Otherwise, routes cannot match the export or import policy, and a network fault occurs.

* If 4-byte AS numbers in integer format are configured, you need to change the format of 4-byte AS numbers in AS\_Path regular expressions or extended community filters to integer accordingly.
* If 4-byte AS numbers in dotted notation are configured, you need to change the format of 4-byte AS numbers in AS\_Path regular expressions or extended community filters to dotted notation accordingly.



#### Procedure

1. Enter the system view.
   
   
   ```
   [system-view](cmdqueryname=system-view)
   ```
2. Change the display format of BGP 4-byte AS numbers to integer.
   
   
   ```
   [as-notation plain](cmdqueryname=as-notation+plain)
   ```
   
   Running the [**as-notation plain**](cmdqueryname=as-notation+plain) command affects the display format of the **display** and **debug** commands, the matching results of AS\_Path regular expressions, and the matching results of extended community filters, but does not affect the format of the configuration information generated by the system.
3. Commit the configuration.
   
   
   ```
   [commit](cmdqueryname=commit)
   ```

#### Verifying the Configuration

After configuring the display format of 4-byte AS numbers, verify the configuration.

* Run the [**display bgp peer**](cmdqueryname=display+bgp+peer) [ [ *ipv4-address* ] **verbose** ] command to check whether the display format of 4-byte AS numbers is changed.
* Run the [**display bgp routing-table**](cmdqueryname=display+bgp+routing-table) command to check whether the result of matching BGP routes against an AS\_Path regular expression or extended community filter has changed. If a change has occurred, reconfigure the AS\_Path regular expression or extended community filter in time.
