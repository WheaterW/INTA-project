Overview of OSPFv3

#### Definition

Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) is a link-state Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP) developed by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).

OSPF version 2 (OSPFv2) is intended for IPv4, and OSPF version 3 (OSPFv3) is intended for IPv6. OSPFv3 is an enhanced version of OSPFv2 but is an independent routing protocol.


#### Purpose

OSPFv3 is mainly developed as a routing protocol independent of any specific network layer. The internal routing information of OSPFv3 has been redesigned to serve this purpose.
