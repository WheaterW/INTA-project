Configuring a Stub Router
=========================

Configuring a Stub Router

#### Prerequisites

Before configuring a stub router, you have completed the following task:

* [Configure basic OSPFv3 functions](vrp_ospfv3_cfg_0009.html).

#### Context

If a device is overloaded and unable to forward any more packets, you can configure it as a stub router. After this configuration, other OSPFv3 devices do not use this device to forward packets, but they can have a route to it.

Therefore, the stub router can be used to control traffic forwarding. The link cost in each router-LSA generated by the stub router is set to the maximum value (65535).


#### Procedure

1. Enter the system view.
   
   
   ```
   [system-view](cmdqueryname=system-view)
   ```
2. Enter the OSPFv3 view.
   
   
   ```
   [ospfv3](cmdqueryname=ospfv3) [ process-id ]
   ```
3. Configure the device as a stub router.
   
   
   ```
   [stub-router](cmdqueryname=stub-router) [ on-startup [ interval ] ]
   ```
   
   **on-startup** [ *interval* ] specifies an interval during which a device keeps serving as a stub router after startup. By default, the interval is 500 seconds.

   The stub router configured using this command is irrelevant to the devices in a stub area.
4. Commit the configuration.
   
   
   ```
   [commit](cmdqueryname=commit)
   ```

#### Verifying the Configuration

Run the [**display ospfv3**](cmdqueryname=display+ospfv3) [ *process-id* ] **routing** command to check information about the OSPFv3 routing table.
