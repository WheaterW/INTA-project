Overview of IPv6 IS-IS

#### Definition

After an IPv6 IS-IS (IS-ISv6) network is deployed, IPv6 routing information in an AS is discovered and calculated. IS-IS is a dynamic routing protocol initially designed by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) for the Connectionless Network Protocol (CLNP).


#### Purpose

IPv6 networks require a dynamic routing protocol capable of providing accurate and valid routing information for IPv6 packet forwarding. IPv6 IS-IS can meet this requirement with its good scalability. It supports IPv6 network layer protocols and is capable of discovering, generating, and forwarding IPv6 routes.
