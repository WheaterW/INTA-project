#### Procedure

* Run the [**display bgp peer**](cmdqueryname=display+bgp+peer) [ *ipv4-address* ] **verbose** command to check detailed information about peers.
* Run the [**display bgp group**](cmdqueryname=display+bgp+group) [ *group-name* ] command to check information about a specified peer group.
  
  
  
  This command can be used to view information about a BGP peer group only on the device where the peer group is created.
  
  If a peer group name is specified in this command, detailed information about this peer group is displayed. If no peer group name is specified in this command, information about all BGP peer groups is displayed.
