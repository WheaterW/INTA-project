Overview of IS-IS

#### Definition

Intermediate System to Intermediate System (IS-IS) is an Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP) designed to run within an autonomous system (AS). IS-IS is also a link state routing protocol and uses the shortest path first (SPF) algorithm to calculate routes.


#### Purpose

IS-IS is a dynamic routing protocol initially designed by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) for the Connectionless Network Protocol (CLNP). To allow IS-IS to support IP routing, the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) extended and modified IS-IS, which enables IS-IS to be applied to both TCP/IP and Open System Interconnection (OSI) environments. This type of IS-IS is referred to as Integrated IS-IS or Dual IS-IS. In this document, IS-IS refers to Integrated IS-IS, unless otherwise stated.
