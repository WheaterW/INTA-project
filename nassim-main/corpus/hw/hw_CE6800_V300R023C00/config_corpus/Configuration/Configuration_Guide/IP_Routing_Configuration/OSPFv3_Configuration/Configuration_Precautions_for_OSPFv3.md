| OSPFv3 advertises default routes to an NSSA only when at least a neighbor in the full state exists in the backbone area or default routes of another protocol or of another OSPFv3 process exist in the same VPN instance, and the nssa default-route-advertise command is run. | CE6800 series  CE8800 series | CE6820H-48S6CQ/CE6820S-48S6CQ/CE6820H-48S6CQ-K/CE6855-48XS8CQ/CE6860-HAM/CE6860-SAN/CE6863H-48S6CQ/CE6863H-48S6CQ-K/CE6866-48S8CQ-K/CE6866-48S8CQ-P/CE6881H-48S6CQ/CE6881H-48S6CQ-K/CE6881H-48T6CQ/CE6881H-48T6CQ-K/CE6885-48YS8CQ/CE6863E-48S8CQ/CE6885-LL-56F (standard forwarding mode)/CE6885-48YS8CQ-T/CE6885-SAN-56F  CE8850-HAM/CE8850-SAN/CE8851-32CQ8DQ-K/CE8851-32CQ8DQ-P/CE8855-32CQ4BQ/CE8851-32CQ4BQ |
| OSPFv3 checks whether a neighbor in the full state exists in the backbone area before advertising a default route to the stub area. | CE6800 series  CE8800 series | CE6820H-48S6CQ/CE6820S-48S6CQ/CE6820H-48S6CQ-K/CE6855-48XS8CQ/CE6860-HAM/CE6860-SAN/CE6863H-48S6CQ/CE6863H-48S6CQ-K/CE6866-48S8CQ-K/CE6866-48S8CQ-P/CE6881H-48S6CQ/CE6881H-48S6CQ-K/CE6881H-48T6CQ/CE6881H-48T6CQ-K/CE6885-48YS8CQ/CE6863E-48S8CQ/CE6885-LL-56F (standard forwarding mode)/CE6885-48YS8CQ-T/CE6885-SAN-56F  CE8850-HAM/CE8850-SAN/CE8851-32CQ8DQ-K/CE8851-32CQ8DQ-P/CE8855-32CQ4BQ/CE8851-32CQ4BQ |
| The network types of the interfaces on both ends of an OSPFv3 neighbor relationship must be the same so that the interfaces can learn routes after the neighbor relationship is established. Otherwise, the neighbor relationship cannot be established and routes cannot be calculated.  You are advised to use the same network type at both ends. | CE6800 series  CE8800 series | CE6820H-48S6CQ/CE6820S-48S6CQ/CE6820H-48S6CQ-K/CE6855-48XS8CQ/CE6860-HAM/CE6860-SAN/CE6863H-48S6CQ/CE6863H-48S6CQ-K/CE6866-48S8CQ-K/CE6866-48S8CQ-P/CE6881H-48S6CQ/CE6881H-48S6CQ-K/CE6881H-48T6CQ/CE6881H-48T6CQ-K/CE6885-48YS8CQ/CE6863E-48S8CQ/CE6885-LL-56F (standard forwarding mode)/CE6885-48YS8CQ-T/CE6885-SAN-56F  CE8850-HAM/CE8850-SAN/CE8851-32CQ8DQ-K/CE8851-32CQ8DQ-P/CE8855-32CQ4BQ/CE8851-32CQ4BQ |
| If the OSPFv3 neighbor timeout period is too short, the neighbor relationship may go Down due to timeout, affecting services.  You are advised to use the default hello timer and dead timer, or change the dead timer to a value greater than or equal to 40s. | CE6800 series  CE8800 series | CE6820H-48S6CQ/CE6820S-48S6CQ/CE6820H-48S6CQ-K/CE6855-48XS8CQ/CE6860-HAM/CE6860-SAN/CE6863H-48S6CQ/CE6863H-48S6CQ-K/CE6866-48S8CQ-K/CE6866-48S8CQ-P/CE6881H-48S6CQ/CE6881H-48S6CQ-K/CE6881H-48T6CQ/CE6881H-48T6CQ-K/CE6885-48YS8CQ/CE6863E-48S8CQ/CE6885-LL-56F (standard forwarding mode)/CE6885-48YS8CQ-T/CE6885-SAN-56F  CE8850-HAM/CE8850-SAN/CE8851-32CQ8DQ-K/CE8851-32CQ8DQ-P/CE8855-32CQ4BQ/CE8851-32CQ4BQ |
| After the device is restarted, if the BFD session status of the local device or neighbor is AdminDown, the OSPFv3 status is not affected. When the BFD session is renegotiated, if BFD reports the detection status Down but the previous detection status is Up, OSPFv3 sets the neighbor status to Down. In other cases, the OSPFv3 status is not affected. | CE6800 series  CE8800 series | CE6820H-48S6CQ/CE6820S-48S6CQ/CE6820H-48S6CQ-K/CE6855-48XS8CQ/CE6860-HAM/CE6860-SAN/CE6863H-48S6CQ/CE6863H-48S6CQ-K/CE6866-48S8CQ-K/CE6866-48S8CQ-P/CE6881H-48S6CQ/CE6881H-48S6CQ-K/CE6881H-48T6CQ/CE6881H-48T6CQ-K/CE6885-48YS8CQ/CE6863E-48S8CQ/CE6885-LL-56F (standard forwarding mode)/CE6885-48YS8CQ-T/CE6885-SAN-56F  CE8850-HAM/CE8850-SAN/CE8851-32CQ8DQ-K/CE8851-32CQ8DQ-P/CE8855-32CQ4BQ/CE8851-32CQ4BQ |
| 1. Loop detection can be implemented for a maximum of 100,000 imported routes. After the number is exceeded, the LSAs do not advertise route advertisement extension information for loop detection.  2. The scenario where routes are imported to NSSAs is not supported.  3. Redistribute information cannot be advertised for summary routes.  4. After a routing loop is removed, the device cannot automatically exit the routing loop state. To exit the routing loop state and clear the alarm, you need to manually clear the alarm using a command.  5. If the redistribute IDs of different devices conflict, a loop alarm may be falsely reported.  6. Routing loop detection is not supported in scenarios where more than two re-advertisement nodes exist.  7. Loops may fail to be detected in scenarios where a looped route and a non-looped route advertised by multiple nodes form load balancing in a process.  8. If the original route source is withdrawn and a loop is triggered, self-healing is not supported.  9. Route import between public and private networks is not supported.  10. When detecting a routing loop, a re-advertisement node increases the cost of the route to be re-advertised to eliminate the loop. This may cause the traffic direction to be different from the expected path.  11. When the maximum cost is advertised after a routing loop is detected, the apply cost configuration in a route-policy does not take effect.  12. After this function is enabled, LSAs need to be added for each prefix to advertise extended TLVs, which greatly increases memory usage. | CE6800 series  CE8800 series | CE6820H-48S6CQ/CE6820S-48S6CQ/CE6820H-48S6CQ-K/CE6855-48XS8CQ/CE6860-HAM/CE6860-SAN/CE6863H-48S6CQ/CE6863H-48S6CQ-K/CE6866-48S8CQ-K/CE6866-48S8CQ-P/CE6881H-48S6CQ/CE6881H-48S6CQ-K/CE6881H-48T6CQ/CE6881H-48T6CQ-K/CE6885-48YS8CQ/CE6863E-48S8CQ/CE6885-LL-56F (standard forwarding mode)/CE6885-48YS8CQ-T/CE6885-SAN-56F  CE8850-HAM/CE8850-SAN/CE8851-32CQ8DQ-K/CE8851-32CQ8DQ-P/CE8855-32CQ4BQ/CE8851-32CQ4BQ |
