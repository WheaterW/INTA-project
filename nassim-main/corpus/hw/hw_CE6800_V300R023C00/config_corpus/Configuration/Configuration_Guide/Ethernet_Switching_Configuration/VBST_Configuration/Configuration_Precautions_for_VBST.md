| An alternate port backs up the root port. If an alternate port exists on the device, you need to configure loop prevention on both the root port and the alternate port. | CE6800 series  CE8800 series | CE6820H-48S6CQ/CE6820S-48S6CQ/CE6820H-48S6CQ-K/CE6855-48XS8CQ/CE6860-HAM/CE6860-SAN/CE6863H-48S6CQ/CE6863H-48S6CQ-K/CE6866-48S8CQ-K/CE6866-48S8CQ-P/CE6881H-48S6CQ/CE6881H-48S6CQ-K/CE6881H-48T6CQ/CE6881H-48T6CQ-K/CE6885-48YS8CQ/CE6863E-48S8CQ/CE6885-LL-56F (standard forwarding mode)/CE6885-48YS8CQ-T/CE6885-LL-56F (low latency mode)/CE6885-SAN-56F  CE8850-HAM/CE8850-SAN/CE8851-32CQ8DQ-K/CE8851-32CQ8DQ-P/CE8855-32CQ4BQ/CE8851-32CQ4BQ |
| VBST supports only process 0. If other processes exist on a device, the device cannot be switched to the VBST mode.  If 1:N (N is greater than 1) mapping between instances and VLANs has been configured on the device, the mapping must be deleted before the mode is changed from STP to VBST. | CE6800 series  CE8800 series | CE6820H-48S6CQ/CE6820S-48S6CQ/CE6820H-48S6CQ-K/CE6855-48XS8CQ/CE6860-HAM/CE6860-SAN/CE6863H-48S6CQ/CE6863H-48S6CQ-K/CE6866-48S8CQ-K/CE6866-48S8CQ-P/CE6881H-48S6CQ/CE6881H-48S6CQ-K/CE6881H-48T6CQ/CE6881H-48T6CQ-K/CE6885-48YS8CQ/CE6863E-48S8CQ/CE6885-LL-56F (standard forwarding mode)/CE6885-48YS8CQ-T/CE6885-LL-56F (low latency mode)/CE6885-SAN-56F  CE8850-HAM/CE8850-SAN/CE8851-32CQ8DQ-K/CE8851-32CQ8DQ-P/CE8855-32CQ4BQ/CE8851-32CQ4BQ |
| To prevent temporary loops, instance 4094 is reserved in VBST mode. The instance instance-id vlan vlan-id command cannot be used to configure the mapping between instance 4094 and a VLAN. Before switching to the VBST mode, delete the configuration of instance 4094 or use another instance to replace it. | CE6800 series  CE8800 series | CE6820H-48S6CQ/CE6820S-48S6CQ/CE6820H-48S6CQ-K/CE6855-48XS8CQ/CE6860-HAM/CE6860-SAN/CE6863H-48S6CQ/CE6863H-48S6CQ-K/CE6866-48S8CQ-K/CE6866-48S8CQ-P/CE6881H-48S6CQ/CE6881H-48S6CQ-K/CE6881H-48T6CQ/CE6881H-48T6CQ-K/CE6885-48YS8CQ/CE6863E-48S8CQ/CE6885-LL-56F (standard forwarding mode)/CE6885-48YS8CQ-T/CE6885-LL-56F (low latency mode)/CE6885-SAN-56F  CE8850-HAM/CE8850-SAN/CE8851-32CQ8DQ-K/CE8851-32CQ8DQ-P/CE8855-32CQ4BQ/CE8851-32CQ4BQ |
| 1. In VBST networking, if the link type of an interface on the local device is set to access or QinQ, the link type of the interface on the remote device must also be set to access or QinQ.  2. If the link types of the interfaces at both ends are not access or QinQ, the PVIDs of the interfaces at both ends must be the same. Otherwise, the two devices cannot negotiate the VBST status and therefore loops cannot be prevented.  3. A hybrid interface can allow packets from multiple VLANs to pass through in untagged mode and the allowed VLAN ID may be different from the PVID. As a result, VBST negotiation may fail. To prevent this issue, enabling VBST on a hybrid interface is not recommended.  4. VBST-enabled devices and STP-enabled/RSTP-enabled devices may be deployed together on the live network. VBST BPDUs and STP/RSTP BPDUs have different formats. Therefore, VBST-enabled devices and STP-enabled/RSTP-enabled devices cannot communicate with each other. To implement interworking with STP-enabled/RSTP-enabled devices:  · For an access interface, a VBST-enabled device uses STP BPDUs (when it is connected to an STP-enabled device) or RSTP BPDUs (when it is connected to an RSTP-enabled device) to communicate with the remote device based on the VLAN to which the access interface belongs. In this way, topology calculation is performed according to STP/RSTP, which does not differentiate VLANs. Therefore, a spanning tree shared by VLANs is formed.  · For a trunk or hybrid interface:  (1) When a VBST-enabled device is connected to an RSTP-enabled device, the VBST-enabled device uses RSTP BPDUs to communicate with the remote device in VLAN 1 and uses VBST BPDUs with the Data field of RSTP BPDUs to communicate with the remote device in other VLANs.  (2) When a VBST-enabled device is connected to an STP-enabled device, the VBST-enabled device uses STP BPDUs to communicate with the remote device in VLAN 1 and uses VBST BPDUs with the Data field of STP BPDUs to communicate with the remote device in other VLANs. | CE6800 series  CE8800 series | CE6820H-48S6CQ/CE6820S-48S6CQ/CE6820H-48S6CQ-K/CE6855-48XS8CQ/CE6860-HAM/CE6860-SAN/CE6863H-48S6CQ/CE6863H-48S6CQ-K/CE6866-48S8CQ-K/CE6866-48S8CQ-P/CE6881H-48S6CQ/CE6881H-48S6CQ-K/CE6881H-48T6CQ/CE6881H-48T6CQ-K/CE6885-48YS8CQ/CE6863E-48S8CQ/CE6885-LL-56F (standard forwarding mode)/CE6885-48YS8CQ-T/CE6885-LL-56F (low latency mode)/CE6885-SAN-56F  CE8850-HAM/CE8850-SAN/CE8851-32CQ8DQ-K/CE8851-32CQ8DQ-P/CE8855-32CQ4BQ/CE8851-32CQ4BQ |
