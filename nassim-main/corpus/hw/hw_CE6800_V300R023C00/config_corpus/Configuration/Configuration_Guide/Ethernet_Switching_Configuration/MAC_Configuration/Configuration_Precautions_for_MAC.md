| When the configured MAC-limit exceeds the upper limit, configurations such as command lines can be delivered normally, but the maximum number of MAC address entries allowed by a board takes effect. | CE6800 series  CE8800 series | CE6820H-48S6CQ/CE6820S-48S6CQ/CE6820H-48S6CQ-K/CE6855-48XS8CQ/CE6860-HAM/CE6860-SAN/CE6863H-48S6CQ/CE6863H-48S6CQ-K/CE6866-48S8CQ-K/CE6866-48S8CQ-P/CE6881H-48S6CQ/CE6881H-48S6CQ-K/CE6881H-48T6CQ/CE6881H-48T6CQ-K/CE6885-48YS8CQ/CE6863E-48S8CQ/CE6885-LL-56F (standard forwarding mode)/CE6885-48YS8CQ-T/CE6885-LL-56F (low latency mode)/CE6885-SAN-56F  CE8850-HAM/CE8850-SAN/CE8851-32CQ8DQ-K/CE8851-32CQ8DQ-P/CE8855-32CQ4BQ/CE8851-32CQ4BQ |
| 1. When the local M-LAG member interface is down, the outbound interface in the displayed MAC address entry is the peer-link or virtual peer-link interface.  2. In MAC address entries synchronized from an isolated interface (unpaired M-LAG member interface) on the remote device, the outbound interface is the peer-link or virtual peer-link interface.  3. When the number of MAC address entries on the virtual peer-link interface is queried using the display mac-address total-number interface command, the number of MAC address entries synchronized from the remote M-LAG member device is not included.  4. When the number of MAC address entries on the peer-link interface is queried using the display mac-address total-number interface command, the number of MAC address entries synchronized from the remote M-LAG member device can be included. | CE6800 series  CE8800 series | CE6820H-48S6CQ/CE6820S-48S6CQ/CE6820H-48S6CQ-K/CE6855-48XS8CQ/CE6860-HAM/CE6860-SAN/CE6863H-48S6CQ/CE6863H-48S6CQ-K/CE6866-48S8CQ-K/CE6866-48S8CQ-P/CE6881H-48S6CQ/CE6881H-48S6CQ-K/CE6881H-48T6CQ/CE6881H-48T6CQ-K/CE6885-48YS8CQ/CE6863E-48S8CQ/CE6885-LL-56F (standard forwarding mode)/CE6885-48YS8CQ-T/CE6885-LL-56F (low latency mode)/CE6885-SAN-56F  CE8850-HAM/CE8850-SAN/CE8851-32CQ8DQ-K/CE8851-32CQ8DQ-P/CE8855-32CQ4BQ/CE8851-32CQ4BQ |
| 1. If MAC address flapping occurs more than 10 times, the device disables the MAC address-triggered ARP entry update function.  2. After MAC address flapping is eliminated, the device uses a 1-second timer to detect whether there are new MAC address flapping entries. If so, the device enables the MAC address-triggered ARP entry update function. | CE6800 series  CE8800 series | CE6820H-48S6CQ/CE6820S-48S6CQ/CE6820H-48S6CQ-K/CE6855-48XS8CQ/CE6860-HAM/CE6860-SAN/CE6863H-48S6CQ/CE6863H-48S6CQ-K/CE6866-48S8CQ-K/CE6866-48S8CQ-P/CE6881H-48S6CQ/CE6881H-48S6CQ-K/CE6881H-48T6CQ/CE6881H-48T6CQ-K/CE6885-48YS8CQ/CE6863E-48S8CQ/CE6885-LL-56F (standard forwarding mode)/CE6885-48YS8CQ-T/CE6885-SAN-56F  CE8850-HAM/CE8850-SAN/CE8851-32CQ8DQ-K/CE8851-32CQ8DQ-P/CE8855-32CQ4BQ/CE8851-32CQ4BQ |
| When the CPU usage remains high or the used ETH\_Q\_MACDWN queue space reaches the threshold, EVPN MAC addresses cannot be deleted immediately. EVPN MAC address verification needs to be initiated for recovery after the used ETH\_Q\_MACDWN queue space is reduced to a certain value. The verification recovery time is about 7 minutes with the time for deleting MAC addresses from the hardware table included. | CE6800 series  CE8800 series | CE6855-48XS8CQ/CE6860-HAM/CE6860-SAN/CE6863H-48S6CQ/CE6863H-48S6CQ-K/CE6866-48S8CQ-K/CE6866-48S8CQ-P/CE6881H-48S6CQ/CE6881H-48S6CQ-K/CE6881H-48T6CQ/CE6881H-48T6CQ-K/CE6885-48YS8CQ/CE6863E-48S8CQ/CE6885-LL-56F (standard forwarding mode)/CE6885-48YS8CQ-T/CE6885-SAN-56F  CE8850-HAM/CE8850-SAN/CE8851-32CQ8DQ-K/CE8851-32CQ8DQ-P/CE8855-32CQ4BQ/CE8851-32CQ4BQ |
| If the device receives traffic in which the source MAC address is the local system MAC address, the local system MAC address is learned when there is no VLANIF interface on the device. | CE6800 series  CE8800 series | CE6820H-48S6CQ/CE6820S-48S6CQ/CE6820H-48S6CQ-K/CE6855-48XS8CQ/CE6860-HAM/CE6860-SAN/CE6863H-48S6CQ/CE6863H-48S6CQ-K/CE6866-48S8CQ-K/CE6866-48S8CQ-P/CE6881H-48S6CQ/CE6881H-48S6CQ-K/CE6881H-48T6CQ/CE6881H-48T6CQ-K/CE6885-48YS8CQ/CE6863E-48S8CQ/CE6885-LL-56F (standard forwarding mode)/CE6885-48YS8CQ-T/CE6885-LL-56F (low latency mode)/CE6885-SAN-56F  CE8850-HAM/CE8850-SAN/CE8851-32CQ8DQ-K/CE8851-32CQ8DQ-P/CE8855-32CQ4BQ/CE8851-32CQ4BQ |
| After MAC address learning limit is enabled on an inter-card Eth-Trunk, only MAC address learning on the local card is limited. When the number of learned MAC addresses reaches the limit and an alarm is generated, the alarm is cleared if the number of learned MAC addresses on a card falls below the limit. If the number of learned MAC addresses on other cards reaches the limit, an alarm is generated again based on the 20-minute timer. After VLAN-based MAC address learning limit is enabled on an inter-card Eth-Trunk and an alarm is generated when the limit is reached, if the outbound interfaces of MAC address entries learned by different cards are physical interfaces, the alarm is cleared when MAC addresses are deleted based on physical interfaces. After 20 minutes, an alarm is reported again if the number of learned MAC addresses on a card reaches the limit. | CE6800 series  CE8800 series | CE6820H-48S6CQ/CE6820S-48S6CQ/CE6820H-48S6CQ-K/CE6855-48XS8CQ/CE6860-HAM/CE6860-SAN/CE6863H-48S6CQ/CE6863H-48S6CQ-K/CE6866-48S8CQ-K/CE6866-48S8CQ-P/CE6881H-48S6CQ/CE6881H-48S6CQ-K/CE6881H-48T6CQ/CE6881H-48T6CQ-K/CE6885-48YS8CQ/CE6863E-48S8CQ/CE6885-LL-56F (standard forwarding mode)/CE6885-48YS8CQ-T/CE6885-LL-56F (low latency mode)/CE6885-SAN-56F  CE8850-HAM/CE8850-SAN/CE8851-32CQ8DQ-K/CE8851-32CQ8DQ-P/CE8855-32CQ4BQ/CE8851-32CQ4BQ |
| 1. When the display mac-address command is run to query MAC address entries, the aging time is the time recorded in the software-based MAC address table.  2. The time when MAC addresses are learned on different cards recorded in the software-based MAC address table may be different due to inter-card synchronization and software-based and hardware-based table synchronization.  3. You are advised to query MAC address entries based on the slot ID. | CE6800 series  CE8800 series | CE6820H-48S6CQ/CE6820S-48S6CQ/CE6820H-48S6CQ-K/CE6855-48XS8CQ/CE6860-HAM/CE6860-SAN/CE6863H-48S6CQ/CE6863H-48S6CQ-K/CE6866-48S8CQ-K/CE6866-48S8CQ-P/CE6881H-48S6CQ/CE6881H-48S6CQ-K/CE6881H-48T6CQ/CE6881H-48T6CQ-K/CE6885-48YS8CQ/CE6863E-48S8CQ/CE6885-LL-56F (standard forwarding mode)/CE6885-48YS8CQ-T/CE6885-LL-56F (low latency mode)/CE6885-SAN-56F  CE8850-HAM/CE8850-SAN/CE8851-32CQ8DQ-K/CE8851-32CQ8DQ-P/CE8855-32CQ4BQ/CE8851-32CQ4BQ |
| 1. MAC address flapping detection takes effect only in a single ring. In a multi-ring scenario, this function takes effect only in the first ring where MAC address flapping occurs. Specially, if two or more rings exist in a VLAN where MAC address flapping is detected, only information about the interfaces in the first ring where MAC address flapping occurs is displayed in a MAC address flapping alarm, regardless of whether these interfaces are up or down.  2. A device with MAC address flapping detection enabled can detect MAC address flapping only in the first ring where MAC address flapping occurs in a VLAN within a set aging period (configurable, 5 minutes by default). For example, MAC address flapping occurs on PortA and PortB in a VLAN. After either PortA or PortB is set to down, MAC address flapping occurs on PortC and PortD within the same aging period. In this case, a MAC address flapping alarm is generated, indicating that MAC address flapping occurs between PortA and PortB.  3. When MAC address flapping occurs and the loop is not removed, the values in the Original-Port and Move-Ports fields remain unchanged in MAC address flapping records, if the interfaces where MAC address flapping occurs are added to or removed from an Eth-Trunk interface. Delete the MAC address entry that contains the move interface after the loop is removed, and perform MAC address flapping detection again. This facilitates detection on original and move interfaces, and ensures correct loop location and delivery of punishment actions (such as error-down and storm suppression on interfaces) to move interfaces.  4. When frequent switchovers occur on the ring network, the number of MAC address moves may exceed the specified value within a specified period. As a result, the mac-address flapping detection alarm is triggered. In this case, you are advised to lower the MAC address flapping detection security level or prolong the revertive switching time on the ring network. | CE6800 series  CE8800 series | CE6820H-48S6CQ/CE6820S-48S6CQ/CE6820H-48S6CQ-K/CE6855-48XS8CQ/CE6860-HAM/CE6860-SAN/CE6863H-48S6CQ/CE6863H-48S6CQ-K/CE6866-48S8CQ-K/CE6866-48S8CQ-P/CE6881H-48S6CQ/CE6881H-48S6CQ-K/CE6881H-48T6CQ/CE6881H-48T6CQ-K/CE6885-48YS8CQ/CE6863E-48S8CQ/CE6885-LL-56F (standard forwarding mode)/CE6885-48YS8CQ-T/CE6885-LL-56F (low latency mode)/CE6885-SAN-56F  CE8850-HAM/CE8850-SAN/CE8851-32CQ8DQ-K/CE8851-32CQ8DQ-P/CE8855-32CQ4BQ/CE8851-32CQ4BQ |
| 1. When MAC address flapping is associated with storm suppression, the suppression behavior takes effect on physical interfaces. Traffic on the sub-interfaces configured on the physical interface is also suppressed.  2. MAC address flapping-triggered storm suppression cannot take effect on sub-interfaces.  3. If the original interface where MAC address flapping occurs is a trusted interface, storm suppression and sandbox take effect only on the move interface of the local card.  4. MAC address flapping-triggered storm suppression can be implemented based on packet types, including unknown unicast, multicast, and broadcast packets. For example, the default suppression action is 1% of the interface rate. Then the rate of unknown unicast, multicast, and broadcast packets is 1% of the interface rate, respectively. | CE6800 series  CE8800 series | CE6820H-48S6CQ/CE6820S-48S6CQ/CE6820H-48S6CQ-K/CE6855-48XS8CQ/CE6860-HAM/CE6860-SAN/CE6863H-48S6CQ/CE6863H-48S6CQ-K/CE6866-48S8CQ-K/CE6866-48S8CQ-P/CE6881H-48S6CQ/CE6881H-48S6CQ-K/CE6881H-48T6CQ/CE6881H-48T6CQ-K/CE6885-48YS8CQ/CE6863E-48S8CQ/CE6885-LL-56F (standard forwarding mode)/CE6885-48YS8CQ-T/CE6885-LL-56F (low latency mode)/CE6885-SAN-56F  CE8850-HAM/CE8850-SAN/CE8851-32CQ8DQ-K/CE8851-32CQ8DQ-P/CE8855-32CQ4BQ/CE8851-32CQ4BQ |
