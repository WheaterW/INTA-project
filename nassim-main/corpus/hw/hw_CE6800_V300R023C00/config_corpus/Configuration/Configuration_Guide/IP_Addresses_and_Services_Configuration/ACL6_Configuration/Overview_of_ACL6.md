Overview of ACL6

#### Definition

An IPv6 access control list (ACL6) is a set of one or more rules that define packet filtering conditions, such as source addresses, destination addresses, and port numbers of packets.

An ACL6 is used by a device to filter packets based on rules contained in the ACL6. Then, the device permits or denies matched packets according to the policy used by the service module where the ACL6 is applied.


#### Purpose

ACL6s accurately identify and control packets on a network to manage network access behaviors, prevent network attacks, and improve bandwidth utilization. In this way, ACL6s ensure security and service quality.
