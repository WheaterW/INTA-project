| DHCP Relay | When configuring the DHCP relay function on the M-LAG, you need to configure the DHCP relay function on the two devices that set up the M-LAG.  To ensure normal service functions, you need to configure precise backhaul or route reselection. | CE6800 series  CE8800 series | CE6820H-48S6CQ/CE6820S-48S6CQ/CE6820H-48S6CQ-K/CE6855-48XS8CQ/CE6860-HAM/CE6860-SAN/CE6863H-48S6CQ/CE6863H-48S6CQ-K/CE6866-48S8CQ-K/CE6866-48S8CQ-P/CE6881H-48S6CQ/CE6881H-48S6CQ-K/CE6881H-48T6CQ/CE6881H-48T6CQ-K/CE6885-48YS8CQ/CE6863E-48S8CQ/CE6885-LL-56F (standard forwarding mode)/CE6885-48YS8CQ-T/CE6885-LL-56F (low latency mode)/CE6885-SAN-56F  CE8850-HAM/CE8850-SAN/CE8851-32CQ8DQ-K/CE8851-32CQ8DQ-P/CE8855-32CQ4BQ/CE8851-32CQ4BQ |
| DHCP Server | When configuring the range of IP addresses that can be dynamically allocated in the global address pool, ensure that the IP address range is on the same network segment as the IP address of the DHCP server interface or DHCP relay interface. Otherwise, incorrect IP addresses may be allocated. | CE6800 series  CE8800 series | CE6820H-48S6CQ/CE6820S-48S6CQ/CE6820H-48S6CQ-K/CE6855-48XS8CQ/CE6860-HAM/CE6860-SAN/CE6863H-48S6CQ/CE6863H-48S6CQ-K/CE6866-48S8CQ-K/CE6866-48S8CQ-P/CE6881H-48S6CQ/CE6881H-48S6CQ-K/CE6881H-48T6CQ/CE6881H-48T6CQ-K/CE6885-48YS8CQ/CE6863E-48S8CQ/CE6885-LL-56F (standard forwarding mode)/CE6885-48YS8CQ-T/CE6885-LL-56F (low latency mode)/CE6885-SAN-56F  CE8850-HAM/CE8850-SAN/CE8851-32CQ8DQ-K/CE8851-32CQ8DQ-P/CE8855-32CQ4BQ/CE8851-32CQ4BQ |
| DHCP Server | The DHCP server function is not configured together with the M-LAG function, but the two functions are not mutually exclusive. This is because the DHCP server function may be used on the device configured with M-LAG. For example, in the ZTP deployment scenario, M-LAG has been configured on the device before the deployment. During the deployment, the device only needs to assign IP addresses to clients.  When configuring the DHCP server function on the device configured with M-LAG, pay attention to the following points:  1. Ensure that sufficient addresses are reserved in the address pool of each M-LAG member. That is, the address pool of a single M-LAG device can meet the address requirements of all terminals, and the address ranges of M-LAG members' address pools cannot overlap. In this scenario, the address pool allocation efficiency is affected.  2. The lease renewal function of a client is unavailable. As a result, the client may obtain an IP address again.  3. The unicast function (the function of expecting the server to unicast response packets) of a client is unavailable.  4. During the M-LAG fault (restart), a client broadcasts a lease renewal packet, which may cause the address to change. | CE6800 series  CE8800 series | CE6820H-48S6CQ/CE6820S-48S6CQ/CE6820H-48S6CQ-K/CE6855-48XS8CQ/CE6860-HAM/CE6860-SAN/CE6863H-48S6CQ/CE6863H-48S6CQ-K/CE6866-48S8CQ-K/CE6866-48S8CQ-P/CE6881H-48S6CQ/CE6881H-48S6CQ-K/CE6881H-48T6CQ/CE6881H-48T6CQ-K/CE6885-48YS8CQ/CE6863E-48S8CQ/CE6885-LL-56F (standard forwarding mode)/CE6885-48YS8CQ-T/CE6885-LL-56F (low latency mode)/CE6885-SAN-56F  CE8850-HAM/CE8850-SAN/CE8851-32CQ8DQ-K/CE8851-32CQ8DQ-P/CE8855-32CQ4BQ/CE8851-32CQ4BQ |

| DHCP Server | Address conflict detection uses the ping address mode and needs to wait for the ping response packet. The timeout period is configurable. If the timeout period is not 0, the address allocation time increases, affecting the user login and logout rates. | CE6800 series  CE8800 series | CE6820H-48S6CQ/CE6820S-48S6CQ/CE6820H-48S6CQ-K/CE6855-48XS8CQ/CE6860-HAM/CE6860-SAN/CE6863H-48S6CQ/CE6863H-48S6CQ-K/CE6866-48S8CQ-K/CE6866-48S8CQ-P/CE6881H-48S6CQ/CE6881H-48S6CQ-K/CE6881H-48T6CQ/CE6881H-48T6CQ-K/CE6885-48YS8CQ/CE6863E-48S8CQ/CE6885-LL-56F (standard forwarding mode)/CE6885-48YS8CQ-T/CE6885-LL-56F (low latency mode)/CE6885-SAN-56F  CE8850-HAM/CE8850-SAN/CE8851-32CQ8DQ-K/CE8851-32CQ8DQ-P/CE8855-32CQ4BQ/CE8851-32CQ4BQ |

| DHCP common | The CAR capability depends on the actual number of packets received by the local device per second.  When the rate of DHCP service packets exceeds the CAR limit, packet loss occurs. The normal packet rate is the same as the packet sending rate. However, the service networking has the following special scenario: The same packet reaches the same device through different paths (the receiving packet rate is a multiple of the packet sending rate). In the typical client-relay agent-server networking, packets from the client can reach the server through the relay agent at Layer 3 or Layer 2. In this case, the server receives two copies of the same packets. If the CAR capability of the server is verified based on the rate at which the client sends packets, the CAR limit is exceeded. | CE6800 series  CE8800 series | CE6820H-48S6CQ/CE6820S-48S6CQ/CE6820H-48S6CQ-K/CE6855-48XS8CQ/CE6860-HAM/CE6860-SAN/CE6863H-48S6CQ/CE6863H-48S6CQ-K/CE6866-48S8CQ-K/CE6866-48S8CQ-P/CE6881H-48S6CQ/CE6881H-48S6CQ-K/CE6881H-48T6CQ/CE6881H-48T6CQ-K/CE6885-48YS8CQ/CE6863E-48S8CQ/CE6885-LL-56F (standard forwarding mode)/CE6885-48YS8CQ-T/CE6885-LL-56F (low latency mode)/CE6885-SAN-56F  CE8850-HAM/CE8850-SAN/CE8851-32CQ8DQ-K/CE8851-32CQ8DQ-P/CE8855-32CQ4BQ/CE8851-32CQ4BQ |
