Overview of ACL

#### Definition

An access control list (ACL) is a set of one or more rules that define packet filtering conditions, such as source addresses, destination addresses, and port numbers of packets.

An ACL is used by a device to filter packets based on rules contained in the ACL. Then, the device permits or denies matched packets according to the policy used by the service module where the ACL is applied.


#### Purpose

ACLs accurately identify and control packets on a network to manage network access behaviors, prevent network attacks, and improve bandwidth utilization. In this way, ACLs ensure security and service quality.
