Overview of DHCP Snooping

#### Definition

Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) snooping is a security feature of DHCP. It ensures that DHCP clients obtain IP addresses from valid DHCP servers and records parameters such as mappings between the IP and MAC addresses of the DHCP clients. This prevents DHCP attacks on the network and provides users with a more secure network environment and more stable network services.


#### Purpose

In actual applications, DHCP encounters many security attacks, such as bogus DHCP server, DHCP server denial of service (DoS), and bogus DHCP message attacks.

To ensure security for communication services, DHCP snooping is introduced to create a firewall between DHCP clients and servers to prevent DHCP attacks on the network.


#### Benefits

* The device can defend against DHCP attacks on the network, enhancing device reliability and ensuring the network runs as normal.
* This feature provides users with a more secure network environment and more stable network services.
