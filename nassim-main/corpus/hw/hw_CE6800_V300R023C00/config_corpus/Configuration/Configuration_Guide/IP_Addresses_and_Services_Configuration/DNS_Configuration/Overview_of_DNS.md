Overview of DNS

#### Definition

TCP/IP allows devices to communicate through IP addresses, but users find it difficult to remember these IP addresses. To resolve this problem, a domain name system (DNS) was designed to match IP addresses with human-readable hostnames.


#### Purpose

A DNS server is configured on a network to establish mappings between domain names and IP addresses. These mappings give users easy-to-remember alternatives for identifying devices.
