| DHCPv6 common | The CAR capability depends on the actual number of packets received by the local device per second.  When the rate of DHCP service packets exceeds the CAR limit, packet loss occurs. The normal packet rate is the same as the packet sending rate. However, the service networking has the following special scenario: The same packet reaches the same device through different paths (the rate of received packets is a multiple of the packet sending rate). In the typical client-relay-server networking, packets from the client can reach the server through the relay agent at Layer 3 or Layer 2. In this case, the server receives two copies of the same packets. In this case, if the CAR capability of the server is verified based on the rate at which the client sends packets. As a result, the CAR limit is exceeded. | CE6800 series  CE8800 series | CE6820H-48S6CQ/CE6820S-48S6CQ/CE6820H-48S6CQ-K/CE6855-48XS8CQ/CE6860-HAM/CE6860-SAN/CE6863H-48S6CQ/CE6863H-48S6CQ-K/CE6866-48S8CQ-K/CE6866-48S8CQ-P/CE6881H-48S6CQ/CE6881H-48S6CQ-K/CE6881H-48T6CQ/CE6881H-48T6CQ-K/CE6885-48YS8CQ/CE6863E-48S8CQ/CE6885-LL-56F (standard forwarding mode)/CE6885-48YS8CQ-T/CE6885-SAN-56F  CE8850-HAM/CE8850-SAN/CE8851-32CQ8DQ-K/CE8851-32CQ8DQ-P/CE8855-32CQ4BQ/CE8851-32CQ4BQ |
| DHCPv6 Relay | When configuring the DHCPv6 relay function on the M-LAG, you need to configure the DHCPv6 relay function on the two devices that set up the M-LAG. | CE6800 series  CE8800 series | CE6820H-48S6CQ/CE6820S-48S6CQ/CE6820H-48S6CQ-K/CE6855-48XS8CQ/CE6860-HAM/CE6860-SAN/CE6863H-48S6CQ/CE6863H-48S6CQ-K/CE6866-48S8CQ-K/CE6866-48S8CQ-P/CE6881H-48S6CQ/CE6881H-48S6CQ-K/CE6881H-48T6CQ/CE6881H-48T6CQ-K/CE6885-48YS8CQ/CE6863E-48S8CQ/CE6885-LL-56F (standard forwarding mode)/CE6885-48YS8CQ-T/CE6885-SAN-56F  CE8850-HAM/CE8850-SAN/CE8851-32CQ8DQ-K/CE8851-32CQ8DQ-P/CE8855-32CQ4BQ/CE8851-32CQ4BQ |
