| If a device establishes a BFD session with a connected device through the M-LAG member interface, and the two M-LAG member devices synchronize BFD protocol packets through peer-link interfaces, BFD protocol packets enter the interface queue with the priority of 6 for forwarding. If service packets enter the interface queue with the priority of 7 for forwarding and the interface uses the default PQ scheduling mode, the BFD session flaps because BFD protocol packets are discarded when the service packets arrive at the interface at the 100% output link rate within a period of time. If other protocol packets are forwarded through peer-link interfaces, the packets may also be discarded due to the scheduling priority problem. | CE6800 series  CE8800 series | CE6820H-48S6CQ/CE6820S-48S6CQ/CE6820H-48S6CQ-K/CE6855-48XS8CQ/CE6860-HAM/CE6860-SAN/CE6863H-48S6CQ/CE6863H-48S6CQ-K/CE6866-48S8CQ-K/CE6866-48S8CQ-P/CE6881H-48S6CQ/CE6881H-48S6CQ-K/CE6881H-48T6CQ/CE6881H-48T6CQ-K/CE6885-48YS8CQ/CE6863E-48S8CQ/CE6885-LL-56F (standard forwarding mode)/CE6885-48YS8CQ-T/CE6885-LL-56F (low latency mode)/CE6885-SAN-56F  CE8850-HAM/CE8850-SAN/CE8851-32CQ8DQ-K/CE8851-32CQ8DQ-P/CE8855-32CQ4BQ/CE8851-32CQ4BQ |

| BFD sessions are supported in the M-LAG system.  1. Only U-BFD echo is supported, and the discriminator remote discr-value command needs to be used to reserve a discriminator for the remote device.  2. BFD configuration needs to be symmetrical. BFD cannot be configured on one end; otherwise, BFD will operate abnormally.  3. In a scenario where an M-LAG has no member interfaces, BFD negotiation fails on the local end. In a scenario where an M-LAG has no member interfaces because the configurations are deleted, the originally negotiated status remains unchanged; however, BFD negotiation cannot be performed again after BFD flapping. | CE6800 series  CE8800 series | CE6820H-48S6CQ/CE6820S-48S6CQ/CE6820H-48S6CQ-K/CE6855-48XS8CQ/CE6860-HAM/CE6860-SAN/CE6863H-48S6CQ/CE6863H-48S6CQ-K/CE6866-48S8CQ-K/CE6866-48S8CQ-P/CE6881H-48S6CQ/CE6881H-48S6CQ-K/CE6881H-48T6CQ/CE6881H-48T6CQ-K/CE6885-48YS8CQ/CE6863E-48S8CQ/CE6885-LL-56F (standard forwarding mode)/CE6885-48YS8CQ-T/CE6885-LL-56F (low latency mode)/CE6885-SAN-56F  CE8850-HAM/CE8850-SAN/CE8851-32CQ8DQ-K/CE8851-32CQ8DQ-P/CE8855-32CQ4BQ/CE8851-32CQ4BQ |
| The product limitation is inherited. When a multi-hop BFD session is configured and the bound peer IP address belongs to the network segment of the management network interface, the BFD session cannot be established.  The type delivered in the routing table of the management interface is not DROP. BFD packets sent through Ethernet match the routing table and cannot be forwarded. As a result, the BFD packets are discarded. This limitation needs to be recorded for scenarios where the management interface cannot be detected. | CE6800 series  CE8800 series | CE6820H-48S6CQ/CE6820S-48S6CQ/CE6820H-48S6CQ-K/CE6855-48XS8CQ/CE6860-HAM/CE6860-SAN/CE6863H-48S6CQ/CE6863H-48S6CQ-K/CE6866-48S8CQ-K/CE6866-48S8CQ-P/CE6881H-48S6CQ/CE6881H-48S6CQ-K/CE6881H-48T6CQ/CE6881H-48T6CQ-K/CE6885-48YS8CQ/CE6863E-48S8CQ/CE6885-LL-56F (standard forwarding mode)/CE6885-48YS8CQ-T/CE6885-LL-56F (low latency mode)/CE6885-SAN-56F  CE8850-HAM/CE8850-SAN/CE8851-32CQ8DQ-K/CE8851-32CQ8DQ-P/CE8855-32CQ4BQ/CE8851-32CQ4BQ |

| Except one-arm BFD Echo sessions, BFD for link-bundle sessions, and multicast BFD sessions, BFD packets of other types of BFD sessions are sent and received on only one board. A BFD session may go down when a port, board, or device fault occurs.  It is recommended that the BFD detection time be greater than the fault convergence time of LAG member interfaces or the time taken to rectify an intermittent disconnection fault of a physical port. | CE6800 series  CE8800 series | CE6820H-48S6CQ/CE6820S-48S6CQ/CE6820H-48S6CQ-K/CE6855-48XS8CQ/CE6860-HAM/CE6860-SAN/CE6863H-48S6CQ/CE6863H-48S6CQ-K/CE6866-48S8CQ-K/CE6866-48S8CQ-P/CE6881H-48S6CQ/CE6881H-48S6CQ-K/CE6881H-48T6CQ/CE6881H-48T6CQ-K/CE6885-48YS8CQ/CE6863E-48S8CQ/CE6885-LL-56F (standard forwarding mode)/CE6885-48YS8CQ-T/CE6885-LL-56F (low latency mode)/CE6885-SAN-56F  CE8850-HAM/CE8850-SAN/CE8851-32CQ8DQ-K/CE8851-32CQ8DQ-P/CE8855-32CQ4BQ/CE8851-32CQ4BQ |

| The device's timeout mechanism for the first BFD packet prevents a BFD session down event from being incorrectly reported. This mechanism enables the device to start BFD timeout detection upon receipt of the packet carrying the Up state from the peer after a BFD session is established. If no BFD packet is received from the peer, the device reports a BFD session down event only after the timeout period of the first BFD packet expires.  The timeout period of the first BFD packet is 50 seconds. | CE6800 series  CE8800 series | CE6820H-48S6CQ/CE6820S-48S6CQ/CE6820H-48S6CQ-K/CE6855-48XS8CQ/CE6860-HAM/CE6860-SAN/CE6863H-48S6CQ/CE6863H-48S6CQ-K/CE6866-48S8CQ-K/CE6866-48S8CQ-P/CE6881H-48S6CQ/CE6881H-48S6CQ-K/CE6881H-48T6CQ/CE6881H-48T6CQ-K/CE6885-48YS8CQ/CE6863E-48S8CQ/CE6885-LL-56F (standard forwarding mode)/CE6885-48YS8CQ-T/CE6885-LL-56F (low latency mode)/CE6885-SAN-56F  CE8850-HAM/CE8850-SAN/CE8851-32CQ8DQ-K/CE8851-32CQ8DQ-P/CE8855-32CQ4BQ/CE8851-32CQ4BQ |
| After a BFD session is configured on a device, if the device receives a BFD packet indicating a down event and the remote discriminator carried in the packet is the same as the local discriminator configured on the device, the BFD session incorrectly reports a down event. | CE6800 series  CE8800 series | CE6820H-48S6CQ/CE6820S-48S6CQ/CE6820H-48S6CQ-K/CE6855-48XS8CQ/CE6860-HAM/CE6860-SAN/CE6863H-48S6CQ/CE6863H-48S6CQ-K/CE6866-48S8CQ-K/CE6866-48S8CQ-P/CE6881H-48S6CQ/CE6881H-48S6CQ-K/CE6881H-48T6CQ/CE6881H-48T6CQ-K/CE6885-48YS8CQ/CE6863E-48S8CQ/CE6885-LL-56F (standard forwarding mode)/CE6885-48YS8CQ-T/CE6885-LL-56F (low latency mode)/CE6885-SAN-56F  CE8850-HAM/CE8850-SAN/CE8851-32CQ8DQ-K/CE8851-32CQ8DQ-P/CE8855-32CQ4BQ/CE8851-32CQ4BQ |

| If BFD sessions bound to Eth-Trunk or VLANIF member interfaces are enabled to modify the port state table (PST), you must configure a wait to restore (WTR) time for the BFD session bound to the Eth-Trunk or VLANIF interface.
