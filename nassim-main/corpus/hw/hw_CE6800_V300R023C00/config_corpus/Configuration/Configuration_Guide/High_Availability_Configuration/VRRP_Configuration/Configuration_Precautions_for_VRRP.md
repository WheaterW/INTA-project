| After the device is restarted, the VRRP priority is adjusted based on the BFD session state.  If the BFD session goes down or the negotiation times out, the VRRP group adjusts its priority based on the Down state of the BFD session.  If the BFD session state is Up or AdminDown, the VRRP group adjusts its priority based on the Up state of the BFD session. | CE6800 series  CE8800 series | CE6820H-48S6CQ/CE6820S-48S6CQ/CE6820H-48S6CQ-K/CE6855-48XS8CQ/CE6860-HAM/CE6860-SAN/CE6863H-48S6CQ/CE6863H-48S6CQ-K/CE6866-48S8CQ-K/CE6866-48S8CQ-P/CE6881H-48S6CQ/CE6881H-48S6CQ-K/CE6881H-48T6CQ/CE6881H-48T6CQ-K/CE6885-48YS8CQ/CE6863E-48S8CQ/CE6885-LL-56F (standard forwarding mode)/CE6885-48YS8CQ-T/CE6885-LL-56F (low latency mode)/CE6885-SAN-56F  CE8850-HAM/CE8850-SAN/CE8851-32CQ8DQ-K/CE8851-32CQ8DQ-P/CE8855-32CQ4BQ/CE8851-32CQ4BQ |
| After VRRP load balancing is enabled, fast ARP reply must be disabled. ARP fast reply enables the device to use the same MAC address to respond to the ARP requests sent from all hosts connected to the gateways, causing a VRRP load balancing failure on the gateways. | CE6800 series  CE8800 series | CE6820H-48S6CQ/CE6820S-48S6CQ/CE6820H-48S6CQ-K/CE6855-48XS8CQ/CE6860-HAM/CE6860-SAN/CE6863H-48S6CQ/CE6863H-48S6CQ-K/CE6866-48S8CQ-K/CE6866-48S8CQ-P/CE6881H-48S6CQ/CE6881H-48S6CQ-K/CE6881H-48T6CQ/CE6881H-48T6CQ-K/CE6885-48YS8CQ/CE6863E-48S8CQ/CE6885-LL-56F (standard forwarding mode)/CE6885-48YS8CQ-T/CE6885-LL-56F (low latency mode)/CE6885-SAN-56F  CE8850-HAM/CE8850-SAN/CE8851-32CQ8DQ-K/CE8851-32CQ8DQ-P/CE8855-32CQ4BQ/CE8851-32CQ4BQ |
| A VRRP group no longer periodically sends VRRP Advertisement packets after it is configured to track mVRRP. Layer 2 devices connected to the gateway need to update their MAC address entries based on gratuitous ARP packets or ARP reply packets received from the gateway. If MAC address entries are cleared on the Layer 2 devices connected to the gateway (due to a ring network switchover or port flapping), the Layer 2 devices may fail to learn the MAC address of the virtual gateway for a long period of time. As a result, traffic floods and packet loss occurs. | CE6800 series  CE8800 series | CE6820H-48S6CQ/CE6820S-48S6CQ/CE6820H-48S6CQ-K/CE6855-48XS8CQ/CE6860-HAM/CE6860-SAN/CE6863H-48S6CQ/CE6863H-48S6CQ-K/CE6866-48S8CQ-K/CE6866-48S8CQ-P/CE6881H-48S6CQ/CE6881H-48S6CQ-K/CE6881H-48T6CQ/CE6881H-48T6CQ-K/CE6885-48YS8CQ/CE6863E-48S8CQ/CE6885-LL-56F (standard forwarding mode)/CE6885-48YS8CQ-T/CE6885-LL-56F (low latency mode)/CE6885-SAN-56F  CE8850-HAM/CE8850-SAN/CE8851-32CQ8DQ-K/CE8851-32CQ8DQ-P/CE8855-32CQ4BQ/CE8851-32CQ4BQ |
