Overview of ZTP

#### Definition

Zero Touch Provisioning (ZTP) enables newly delivered devices or devices with factory configurations to automatically load deployment files (including system software, configuration files, and patch files) when they are powered on and started.


#### Purpose

After devices are installed on the live network, engineers usually need to perform onsite configurations for the devices. Typically, this requires engineers to configure each device locally, which is inefficient and costly, especially if there are a large number of sparsely deployed devices.

To overcome such efficiency and cost challenges, the ZTP function can be enabled on a device. ZTP allows the device to obtain and automatically load deployment files from the file server. This ultimately frees engineers from having to carry out onsite configuration and deployment.
