Overview of the First Login

#### Definition

First login to a device refers to logging in to a new device locally for the first time prior to configuring it.


#### Purpose

After logging in locally, you can configure basic system parameters, such as the device name, management IP address, and system time. You can also configure STelnet to enable remote login.
