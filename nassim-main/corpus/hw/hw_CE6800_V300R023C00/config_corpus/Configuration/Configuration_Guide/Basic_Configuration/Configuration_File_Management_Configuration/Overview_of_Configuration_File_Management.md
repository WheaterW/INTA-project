Overview of Configuration File Management

#### Definition

A configuration file is a collection of command lines that run on a device.


#### Purpose

Configuration file management allows you to view, save, compare, replace, back up, restore, and compress configuration files, as well as delete and roll back configurations in the files. You can also specify the configuration file to be loaded at the next device startup. All this ensures correct configurations on the device, prevents configuration loss, and facilitates configuration migration.
