Overview of Data Collection

#### Definition

Data collection is a technology used to collect the real-time running status of devices. By analyzing the collected data, you can quickly locate faults.


#### Purpose

Devices generate large amounts of data during normal operation, most of which is distributed across various modules and can be difficult to manage as a result. However, the data collection system can collect, process, and store such data in a unified manner, optimizing device data management and facilitating fault locating.
