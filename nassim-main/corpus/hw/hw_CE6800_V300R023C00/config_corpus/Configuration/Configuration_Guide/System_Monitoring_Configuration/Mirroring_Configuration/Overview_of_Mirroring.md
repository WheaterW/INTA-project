Overview of Mirroring

#### Definition

Mirroring is a function used to copy (or mirror) traffic received or sent (or both) on a specified source (known as a mirrored source) to a destination port (known as an observing port) for analysis. Copied packets are known as mirrored packets.


#### Purpose

During network maintenance, you may need to obtain and analyze packets. For example, if you suspect that there are attack packets on the network, you need to be able to obtain and analyze the packets without affecting packet forwarding.

The mirroring function is able to achieve such results. Mirroring copies packets on a mirrored port to an observing port for analysis by a monitoring device without affecting switching of packets on the mirrored port. This function facilitates network monitoring and troubleshooting.
