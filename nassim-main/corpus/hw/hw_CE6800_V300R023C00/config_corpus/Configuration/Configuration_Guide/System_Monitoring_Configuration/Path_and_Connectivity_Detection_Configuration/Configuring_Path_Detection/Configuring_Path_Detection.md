Configuring Path Detection
==========================

Configuring Path Detection

#### Prerequisites

Before configuring path detection, you have completed the following tasks:

* Establish an SNMP connection between iMaster NCE-Fabric and the device.
* Establish a NETCONF connection between iMaster NCE-Fabric and the device.
* Establish an OpenFlow connection between iMaster NCE-Fabric and the device. After NETCONF is configured on iMaster NCE-Fabric, iMaster NCE-Fabric automatically delivers OpenFlow configuration using the NETCONF connection.


#### Context

To provide path detection, the device must work with iMaster NCE-Fabric. For details about how to configure iMaster NCE-Fabric, see the deployment guide of iMaster NCE-Fabric in the corresponding version.
