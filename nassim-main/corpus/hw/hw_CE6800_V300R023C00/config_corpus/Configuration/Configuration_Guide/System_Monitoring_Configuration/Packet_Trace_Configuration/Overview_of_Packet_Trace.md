Overview of Packet Trace

#### Definition

A network typically carries a variety of services. However, packet loss may occur during packet forwarding on network devices, and the causes of such issues can be difficult to locate.

The packet trace function can locate the cause of packet loss that occurs during forwarding on a device.

However, the accuracy of this function may be reduced in cases where packet loss is caused by congestion, which can occur transiently and irregularly.


#### Purpose

After determining that packets are discarded on a device, you can configure packet trace on the device to locate the specific cause, facilitating fault diagnosis.
