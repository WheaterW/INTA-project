The device supports the NetStream function, which is used to collect statistics about and analyze service traffic on the network and may involve obtaining personal data such as IP address and MAC address. Huawei will not collect or store users' communication information without prior user approval. Therefore, you must use this function in compliance with the local laws and regulations, and take proper security protection measures to ensure that personal data of users is fully protected. For example, technical support engineers must not use this function to obtain packets unless they have been authorized by customers. Ensure obtained packets are deleted completely and immediately after the fault is located and analyzed. Huawei will not bear any legal responsibility or liabilities for any security events (such as personal data leakage) that are not the result of Huawei's misconduct.



#### Purpose

The increasing number of services and applications on networks poses higher requirements on collecting statistics about and analyzing traffic. To address this challenge, NetStream is introduced to collect statistics about network traffic and resource usage by category, as well as monitoring and managing networks based on services and resources. NetStream is mainly used for the following purposes:

* Accounting
  
  NetStream provides detailed data based on usage of resources (such as links, bandwidth, and time segments). Such data includes the IP addresses, number of packets, number of bytes, time, type of service (ToS), and application types. Based on the collected data, customers can implement flexible accounting according to the duration, bandwidth, application, and service quality, helping to effectively utilize resources.
* Network monitoring
  
  NetStream monitors network traffic almost in real time. It can be deployed on an interface connected to the Internet to monitor outgoing traffic and to analyze the bandwidth usage of services. Using this traffic monitoring information, network administrators can determine the network running status and discover inappropriate network architectures or performance bottlenecks. Enterprises can then easily plan and allocate network resources based on this information.
