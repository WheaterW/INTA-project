IFIT Application Scenarios
==========================

Currently, IFIT supports the following application scenarios: native IPv4/IPv6 and IPv4/IPv6 over VXLAN. You can use the NMS to monitor traffic on the preceding types of networks in real time to quickly detect abnormal traffic and locate faults.

The NMS refers to iMaster NCE-Fabric (controller) and iMaster NCE-FabricInsight (analyzer).


#### Native IPv4/IPv6

The application scenarios of native IPv4 and native IPv6 are similar. The following uses native IPv4 as an example. On the network shown in [Figure 1](#EN-US_CONCEPT_0000001564005441__fig_dc_vrp_feature_new_ipfpm_000702), traffic measurement methods in native IPv4 packet forwarding scenarios are as follows:

* Measurement of user-to-Internet traffic
* Measurement of user-to-user traffic

#### IPv4/IPv6 over VXLAN

The application scenarios of IPv4 over VXLAN and IPv6 over VXLAN are similar. The following uses IPv4 over VXLAN as an example. On the network shown in [Figure 2](#EN-US_CONCEPT_0000001564005441__fig163051646502), traffic measurement methods in IPv4 over VXLAN packet forwarding scenarios are as follows:

* Measurement of user-to-Internet traffic
* Measurement of user-to-user traffic
