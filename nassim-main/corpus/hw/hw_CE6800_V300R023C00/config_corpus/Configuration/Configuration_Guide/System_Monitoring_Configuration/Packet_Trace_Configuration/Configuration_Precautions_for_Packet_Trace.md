| The detector packet-trace profile packet command configures a packet trace profile. It supports IPv4 and IPv6 profiles, whereas the command in other formats supports only IPv4 profiles. | CE6800 series  CE8800 series | CE6855-48XS8CQ/CE6860-HAM/CE6860-SAN/CE6866-48S8CQ-K/CE6866-48S8CQ-P/CE6885-48YS8CQ/CE6863E-48S8CQ/CE6885-LL-56F (standard forwarding mode)/CE6885-48YS8CQ-T/CE6885-LL-56F (low latency mode)/CE6885-SAN-56F  CE8850-HAM/CE8850-SAN/CE8851-32CQ8DQ-K/CE8851-32CQ8DQ-P/CE8855-32CQ4BQ/CE8851-32CQ4BQ |
| The packet trace function only allows physical interfaces to be specified for receiving detection packets. | CE6800 series  CE8800 series | CE6855-48XS8CQ/CE6860-HAM/CE6860-SAN/CE6866-48S8CQ-K/CE6866-48S8CQ-P/CE6885-48YS8CQ/CE6863E-48S8CQ/CE6885-LL-56F (standard forwarding mode)/CE6885-48YS8CQ-T/CE6885-LL-56F (low latency mode)/CE6885-SAN-56F  CE8850-HAM/CE8850-SAN/CE8851-32CQ8DQ-K/CE8851-32CQ8DQ-P/CE8855-32CQ4BQ/CE8851-32CQ4BQ |
| The packet trace function can locate the cause of packet loss that occurs during forwarding on a device. However, if packet loss is caused by congestion, packet trace may not accurately locate the cause because congestion is unexpected and occurs randomly. | CE6800 series  CE8800 series | CE6855-48XS8CQ/CE6860-HAM/CE6860-SAN/CE6866-48S8CQ-K/CE6866-48S8CQ-P/CE6885-48YS8CQ/CE6863E-48S8CQ/CE6885-LL-56F (standard forwarding mode)/CE6885-48YS8CQ-T/CE6885-LL-56F (low latency mode)/CE6885-SAN-56F  CE8850-HAM/CE8850-SAN/CE8851-32CQ8DQ-K/CE8851-32CQ8DQ-P/CE8855-32CQ4BQ/CE8851-32CQ4BQ |
