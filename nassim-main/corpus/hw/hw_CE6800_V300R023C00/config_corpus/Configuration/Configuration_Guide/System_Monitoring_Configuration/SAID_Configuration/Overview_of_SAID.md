Overview of SAID

#### Definition

System of active immunization and diagnosis (SAID) is an intelligent fault diagnosis system that automatically diagnoses and rectifies some faults by simulating human operations in troubleshooting.


#### Purpose

A network is prone to severe problems if it fails to recover from a service interruption. At present, device reliability is implemented through various detection functions. Once a device fault is detected, the device reports an alarm and records logs. After receiving an alarm, maintenance personnel often fail to collect fault information in a timely manner. As a result, it is difficult to locate the fault and the problem cannot be solved, affecting proper device running. Therefore, an intelligent proactive immunization and diagnosis system needs to be built in the device to enable the device to automatically collect fault information, diagnose faults, and restore services. The system improves the self-healing capability and maintainability of the device.
