The packet content exceeding 180 bytes cannot be parsed, and the corresponding field in the flow table is filled with 0.  3. If the packet length exceeds 180 bytes, the original packet length cannot be counted in statistics about bytes in the flow table. Instead, the packet length is accumulated based on the truncated packets. | CE6800 series | CE6820H-48S6CQ/CE6820S-48S6CQ/CE6820H-48S6CQ-K/CE6863H-48S6CQ/CE6863H-48S6CQ-K/CE6881H-48S6CQ/CE6881H-48S6CQ-K/CE6881H-48T6CQ/CE6881H-48T6CQ-K |

| Packet loss visualization | Packets discarded due to the ACL deny action need to be sampled (at a sampling rate of 1024:1) and sent to the analyzer for creating flow entries. | CE6800 series  CE8800 series | CE6820H-48S6CQ/CE6820S-48S6CQ/CE6820H-48S6CQ-K/CE6860-HAM/CE6860-SAN/CE6863H-48S6CQ/CE6863H-48S6CQ-K/CE6866-48S8CQ-K/CE6866-48S8CQ-P/CE6881H-48S6CQ/CE6881H-48S6CQ-K/CE6881H-48T6CQ/CE6881H-48T6CQ-K  CE8850-HAM/CE8850-SAN/CE8851-32CQ8DQ-K/CE8851-32CQ8DQ-P |

| Latency visualization | For the CE6800 Series:  Inbound and outbound interfaces can be recorded in the latency visualization flow table only when they are physical interfaces.  For the CE6855-48XS8CQ/CE6885-48YS8CQ/CE6863E-48S8CQ/CE6885-LL-56F (standard forwarding mode)/CE6885-48YS8CQ-T/CE6885-SAN-56F:  The flow table discarded in the upstream direction records only the indexes of inbound interfaces, and the flow table discarded in the downstream direction records only the indexes of outbound interfaces.  For the CE8800 Series:  Inbound and outbound interfaces can be recorded in the latency visualization flow table only when they are physical interfaces.  For the CE8855-32CQ4BQ/CE8851-32CQ4BQ:  The flow table discarded in the upstream direction records only the indexes of inbound interfaces, and the flow table discarded in the downstream direction records only the indexes of outbound interfaces. | CE6800 series  CE8800 series | CE6855-48XS8CQ/CE6860-HAM/CE6860-SAN/CE6866-48S8CQ-K/CE6866-48S8CQ-P/CE6885-48YS8CQ/CE6863E-48S8CQ/CE6885-LL-56F (standard forwarding mode)/CE6885-48YS8CQ-T/CE6885-SAN-56F  CE8850-HAM/CE8850-SAN/CE8851-32CQ8DQ-K/CE8851-32CQ8DQ-P/CE8855-32CQ4BQ/CE8851-32CQ4BQ |
| Latency visualization | The collected and sent information does not include tunnel packets or Ethernet packet headers (except when TLL is 0 or 1). The following fields are not included: tunnel source IP address, tunnel destination IP address, source MAC address, destination MAC address, VLAN ID, ETH type, and peak latency. | CE6800 series  CE8800 series | CE6855-48XS8CQ/CE6885-48YS8CQ/CE6863E-48S8CQ/CE6885-LL-56F (standard forwarding mode)/CE6885-48YS8CQ-T/CE6885-LL-56F (low latency mode)/CE6885-SAN-56F  CE8855-32CQ4BQ/CE8851-32CQ4BQ |
| Latency visualization | 1. When the number of hardware flow entries exceeds the specification, the statistics about packets and bytes in the flow table may be inaccurate.  2.
