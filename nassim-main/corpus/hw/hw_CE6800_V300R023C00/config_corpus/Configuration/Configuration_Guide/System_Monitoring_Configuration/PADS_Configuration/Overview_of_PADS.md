Overview of PADS

#### Definition

The protocol-aided diagnosis system (PADS) is an intelligent diagnosis system. It simulates experts in multiple fields to automatically prevent, discover, diagnose, and rectify service faults 24/7.


#### Purpose

PADS is developed based on technical research on future-oriented O&M. Designed based on common fault modes summarized from thousands of faults reported by customers, it simulates experts to monitor the status of IP protocol-related functional modules in real time. PADS aims to enable users to implement complex protocol O&M. To achieve this, PADS provides a unified O&M interface, hierarchical fault diagnosis, and capabilities to diagnose and process common component, device, system, and network faults. Moreover, it can record and analyze exception symptoms before a fault occurs, and automatically diagnose, isolate, and rectify faults, achieving intelligent O&M of devices on the live network.


#### Benefits

PADS simplifies O&M, improves O&M efficiency, and reduces O&M costs.
