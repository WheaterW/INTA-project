| Flow Sampling | 1. If a global sampling rate is configured but no sampling rate is configured on an Eth-Trunk interface, the Eth-Trunk interface uses the global sampling rate. If a global sampling rate is configured and a sampling rate is configured on an Eth-Trunk interface, the Eth-Trunk interface uses the sampling rate configured on the Eth-Trunk interface.  2. If the sampling rate configured on an Eth-Trunk interface is different from that configured on member interfaces of the Eth-Trunk interface, the sampling rate configured on the Eth-Trunk interface takes effect, and the sampling rate configured on member interfaces of the Eth-Trunk interface does not take effect.  3. If a global sampling rate is not configured, no sampling rate is configured on an Eth-Trunk interface, but a sampling rate is configured on member interfaces of the Eth-Trunk interface, the sampling rate configured on member interfaces of the Eth-Trunk interface takes effect. In this case, the sampling function is disabled on the Eth-Trunk interface and its sub-interfaces. | CE6800 series  CE8800 series | CE6820H-48S6CQ/CE6820S-48S6CQ/CE6820H-48S6CQ-K/CE6855-48XS8CQ/CE6860-HAM/CE6860-SAN/CE6863H-48S6CQ/CE6863H-48S6CQ-K/CE6866-48S8CQ-K/CE6866-48S8CQ-P/CE6881H-48S6CQ/CE6881H-48S6CQ-K/CE6881H-48T6CQ/CE6881H-48T6CQ-K/CE6885-48YS8CQ/CE6863E-48S8CQ/CE6885-LL-56F (standard forwarding mode)/CE6885-48YS8CQ-T/CE6885-LL-56F (low latency mode)/CE6885-SAN-56F  CE8850-HAM/CE8850-SAN/CE8851-32CQ8DQ-K/CE8851-32CQ8DQ-P/CE8855-32CQ4BQ/CE8851-32CQ4BQ |

| Flow Sampling | 1. When NetStream sampling in configured only on a main interface, the device can sample packets on Layer 2 and Layer 3 sub-interfaces, and the interface index in the sampled packets is the main interface index.

When NetStream sampling is configured on a physical interface, an Eth-Trunk interface, or an Eth-Trunk member interface, the device can sample packets on Layer 3 and Layer 2 sub-interfaces of the interface. However, when NetStream sampling is configured on a physical interface or an Eth-Trunk interface, as well as its Layer 3 or Layer 2 sub-interfaces, the NetStream configuration on each interface only takes effect locally. | CE6800 series  CE8800 series | CE6820H-48S6CQ/CE6820S-48S6CQ/CE6820H-48S6CQ-K/CE6855-48XS8CQ/CE6860-HAM/CE6860-SAN/CE6863H-48S6CQ/CE6863H-48S6CQ-K/CE6866-48S8CQ-K/CE6866-48S8CQ-P/CE6881H-48S6CQ/CE6881H-48S6CQ-K/CE6881H-48T6CQ/CE6881H-48T6CQ-K/CE6885-48YS8CQ/CE6863E-48S8CQ/CE6885-LL-56F (standard forwarding mode)/CE6885-48YS8CQ-T/CE6885-SAN-56F  CE8850-HAM/CE8850-SAN/CE8851-32CQ8DQ-K/CE8851-32CQ8DQ-P/CE8855-32CQ4BQ/CE8851-32CQ4BQ |
