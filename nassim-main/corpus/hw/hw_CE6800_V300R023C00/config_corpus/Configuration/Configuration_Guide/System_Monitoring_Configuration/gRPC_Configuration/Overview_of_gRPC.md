Overview of gRPC

#### Definition

Google Remote Procedure Call (gRPC) is a high-performance, open source universal RPC framework initially developed by Google. It uses HTTP/2 for transport, and provides multiple methods available in multiple programming languages for configuring and managing network devices.


#### Purpose

As networks become more complex, remote calls between services become widely used, posing urgent requirements on remote call tools. As such, gRPC is introduced to meet this requirement. gRPC is applicable to telemetry subscription management scenarios and can meet the industry's large-scale and high-performance network monitoring requirements. gRPC can also be used for device query and configuration management, allowing administrators to quickly obtain device exception information and perform network convergence and service switchover in a timely manner, so as to prevent service interruption caused by packet loss. To achieve this, gRPC provides the configuration, query, and capability obtaining methods, which are used by devices connected to a collector for reporting device data.
