<h1 class="topicTitle-h1">SZTP Fundamentals</h1>
<div><div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Context</h4><p>SZTP applies to scenarios that require high security. DHCP-based ZTP is easy to implement because you only need to deploy a DHCP server. However, it may lead to data leakage or interception, posing security risks. To mitigate the security risks, you can deploy a DHCP server and a dedicated bootstrap server and use two-way authentication and data encryption.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Basic Networking</h4><p>In <a href="#EN-US_CONCEPT_0000001513154370__fig16534750131417">Figure 1</a>, the device functions as a DHCP client to periodically send DHCP request packets to the DHCP server in order to obtain configuration information. The DHCP server responds with DHCP reply packets that contain information about the IP address allocated to the device, as well as the IP address or domain name of the bootstrap server. After obtaining such information, the device establishes an HTTPS connection with the bootstrap server through two-way authentication based on an initial certificate. The device then obtains information about deployment files from the bootstrap server, connects to the deployment file server, obtains the deployment files, and sets them as the files to be loaded for the next startup. These deployment files are then automatically loaded by the device upon restart.</p>

<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Trusted Connection</h4><p>During SZTP, the device establishes a trusted connection with the bootstrap server through two-way authentication and obtains deployment file information from the server. The device then functions as an HTTPS client to establish an HTTPS connection with the deployment file server and download deployment files. Certificates listed in <a href="#EN-US_CONCEPT_0000001513154370__table728912121159">Table 1</a> are required for establishing a secure connection between the device and bootstrap server.</p>

<p>In practice, you can deploy one or more bootstrap servers based on security requirements. If multiple bootstrap servers are deployed, a redirect-to bootstrap server address may be configured on a bootstrap server. Redirection information is stored in Redirect Information. When an untrusted connection is established between the device and bootstrap server, the bootstrap server encapsulates the Redirect Information, ownership voucher, and owner certificate into bootstrapping data and sends the data to the device to establish a trusted connection. The device then obtains the IP address of the redirect-to bootstrap server and the trust anchor certificate from the Redirect Information. After the trust anchor certificate is installed, the device establishes a trusted connection with the redirect-to bootstrap server until the device obtains the onboarding information, which contains deployment file information.</p>

<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Deployment Process</h4><p><a href="#EN-US_CONCEPT_0000001513154370__fig833142114548">Figure 3</a> shows the SZTP process.</p>
<div class="fignone" id="EN-US_CONCEPT_0000001513154370__fig833142114548"><a name="EN-US_CONCEPT_0000001513154370__fig833142114548"></a><a name="fig833142114548"></a><span class="figcap"><b>Figure 3 </b>SZTP process</span><br><span><img src="../images/en-us_image_0000001720755253.png" width="NaN" height="NaN"></span></div>
<p>The SZTP process involves the following phases:</p>
<ol><li><p>Powering on and starting the device</p>
<p>If a non-factory configuration file is available, the device starts with that configuration file. Otherwise, the device automatically starts the ZTP process.</p>
</li><li><p>Obtaining DHCP information</p>
<p>The device broadcasts DHCP Request packets through its management network interface and Ethernet interfaces. The DHCP server sends a DHCP reply packet to the device. If the reply packet contains the DHCP option 143 field, the device starts the SZTP process. If the reply packet does not contain the DHCP option 143 field, the device starts the DHCP-based ZTP process. After entering the SZTP process, the device obtains information such as the device IP address, default gateway address, Syslog server address, and bootstrap server address from the DHCP server. The device obtains the IPv4 address of the Syslog server from the DHCP reply packet to enable the Syslog server function. Information about important phases during SZTP is recorded in user logs, which the Syslog server will upload to the NMS.</p>
</li><li><p>Obtaining deployment file information</p>
<p>The device parses the bootstrap server address from the DHCP option 143 field, establishes a secure connection with the bootstrap server, and obtains deployment file information.</p>
</li><li><p>Restarting the device</p>
<p>The device automatically sets the downloaded deployment files as those to be loaded for its next startup. The device then restarts to complete automatic deployment.</p>
</li></ol>
<div class="note"><img src="../public_sys-resources/note_3.0-en-us.png"><span class="notetitle"> </span><div class="notebody"><ul><li>When deploying a device with factory configurations, you are advised not to manually deliver the same configurations as those delivered during ZTP. If the deployment fails, the configurations will be deleted.</li><li>SZTP processes depend on OPS. You can run the <strong>ops stop process</strong> <em>process-id</em> command to stop a ZTP process. Running this command may retain the configurations that have been delivered during SZTP on the device.</li></ul>
