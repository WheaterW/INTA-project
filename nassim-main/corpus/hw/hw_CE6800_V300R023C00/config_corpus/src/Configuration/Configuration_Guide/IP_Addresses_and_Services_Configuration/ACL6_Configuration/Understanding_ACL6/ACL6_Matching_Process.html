<div><div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">ACL6 Rule ID</h4><ul><li>All rules in an ACL6 are identified by rule IDs and arranged in ascending order of ID. Rule IDs can be manually configured or automatically generated based on the ACL6 step.</li><li>If rule IDs are automatically generated, they are incremented in predefined steps. For example, if the ACL6 step is set to 5, the difference between rule IDs will be 5. In this case, the first rule ID is 5, and subsequent IDs will increase by increments of 5. This facilitates ACL6 management, enabling you to add new rules between existing ones.</li><li>In the configuration file, the rules are displayed in ascending order of ID, not in the order of configuration.</li></ul>
</div>
<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">ACL6 Matching Mechanism</h4><p>A device stops matching packets against ACL6 rules once the packets match a rule.</p>
<div class="p">After a packet is filtered by an ACL6, the packet may be matched or unmatched:<ul><li>Matched: The packet matches a rule in the ACL6.</li><li>Unmatched: The packet does not match any rule in the ACL6, the ACL6 is unavailable, or the ACL6 does not contain rules.</li></ul>
</div>
<p>Whether packets are permitted or denied is determined by actions specified in matched rules of an ACL6 and the service module that has this ACL6 applied. Different service modules may process the packets that are filtered by ACL6 rules in different ways.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">ACL6 Matching Order</h4><div class="p">The system matches packets against ACL6 rules in ascending order of rule IDs. That is, the rule with the smallest ID takes effect first. <ul><li>If a smaller ID is manually specified for a rule, the rule takes effect earlier than those with larger IDs.</li><li>If no ID is manually specified for a rule, the system allocates one. This rule ID is the largest in the ACL6 and has the minimum multiple of the step. Therefore, this rule is the last one that functions.</li></ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">ACL6 Step</h4><div class="p">An ACL6 step is the difference between two adjacent ACL6 rule IDs that are automatically allocated. For example, if the ACL6 step is set to 5, the rule IDs are multiples of 5, such as 5, 10, 15, and 20.<ul><li>If an ACL6 step is changed, rules in the ACL6 are automatically renumbered according to the new step, with the start rule ID being the step value. For example, if the ACL6 step is changed from 5 to 2, the original rule IDs 5, 10, 15, and 20 will be renumbered as 2, 4, 6 and 8.</li><li>If the default step of 5 is restored for an ACL6, the system immediately renumbers the rules in the ACL6 based on the default step. For example, the step of ACL6 3001 is 2, and rules in ACL6 3001 are numbered 0, 2, 4, and 6. In this case, if the default step 5 is restored, the rules will be renumbered as 5, 10, 15, and 20.</li></ul>
</div>
<p>An ACL6 step can be used to maintain ACL6 rules, making it convenient to add new ones. For example, if you have created four rules numbered 0, 5, 10, and 15 in an ACL6, you can add rules between any two rules, such as rule 1 between rules 0 and 5.</p>
