<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Threats to Network Security</h4><p>Existing or potential security events may threaten the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of resources in a network system. Network security services can mitigate network security threats to a certain extent and within a specified scope.</p>
<div class="p">It is critical that a device is able to forward data without data interception or tampering. Network security involves:<ul><li>Confidentiality: Data stored, processed, and transmitted by a device must not be leaked to unauthorized users, entities, or processes. Data must be available only to authorized users.</li><li>Integrity: Data cannot be modified without authorization. That is, network information must not be deleted, modified, forged, unsequenced, replayed, or inserted during storage and transmission.</li><li>Availability: As long as required external resources are available, functions of a device can be executed under specific conditions and at a specific time or within a specific time period. Sustainable services must be provided to meet carrier-class quality of service (QoS) requirements.</li></ul>
</div>
<p>To meet the preceding requirements, plan and deploy network security on three planes: management plane, control plane, and forwarding plane.</p>
<div class="fignone" id="EN-US_CONCEPT_0000001512848654__fig12995182183819"><a name="EN-US_CONCEPT_0000001512848654__fig12995182183819"></a><a name="fig12995182183819"></a><span class="figcap"><b>Figure 1 </b>Security deployment planes</span><br><span><img class="vsd" src="../images/en-us_image_0000001513048246.png" width="NaN" height="NaN"></span></div>
</div>
<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Management Plane</h4><p>The key to security of the management plane is to ensure that devices can be managed only by authorized users, including who can log in to a device and what operations they can perform. As shown in <a href="#EN-US_CONCEPT_0000001512848654__fig12995182183819">Figure 1</a>, the security of the management plane is mainly achieved by allowing only the administrator to log in to the device. This is implemented by configuring user names, passwords, and ACLs to control login of users, enabling the administrator to log in through STelnet, and configuring the user level to control the operations users can perform. For details, see <a href="../vrp_login_cfg_0001.html">CLI-based Device Login Configuration</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Control Plane</h4><p>The control plane controls data forwarding based on the CPU. The CPU is the brain of a device, controlling operations of device components. Therefore, security of the CPU must be guaranteed so that devices and protocols function normally. If too many protocol packets are sent to the CPU, the CPU will become overloaded, leading to poor device performance and service interruptions. As the core component of a device, the CPU is one of the major targets of attacks from unauthorized users. Devices support security protection services on the control plane, including <a href="../galaxy_localattackdefense_cfg_0001.html">local attack defense</a>.</p>
<div class="p">As shown in <a href="#EN-US_CONCEPT_0000001512848654__fig41188174420">Figure 2</a>, the default Central Processing Unit-committed Access Rate (CPCAR) value limits the rate of CPU-bound protocol packets to ensure that the CPU runs normally. If the CPU usage is still high after CPCAR limiting is performed, perform the following steps:<ul><li>Adjust the CPCAR value: Decrease the CPCAR value to reduce the number of CPU-bound protocol packets.</li><li>Trace attack sources: Analyze the CPU-bound protocol packets, and set the threshold for the number of packets sent to the CPU. Take measures to handle packets exceeding the threshold, for example, dropping the packets, shutting down interfaces, and configuring a blacklist.</li></ul>

</div>
<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Forwarding Plane</h4><div class="p">The forwarding plane searches for forwarding entries to perform data forwarding. There are two types of attacks targeting the forwarding plane:<ul><li>Exhausting forwarding entries: prevents forwarding entries of authorized users from being learned and their traffic from being forwarded.</li><li>Tampering with forwarding entries: causes traffic of authorized users to be forwarded to incorrect destinations.</li></ul>
</div>
<div class="p">A device can defend against attacks at Layer 2 and Layer 3.<ul><li>Layer 2 network: Layer 2 data is forwarded based on the MAC address table. That is, the device needs to search for MAC address entries to forward data traffic. Therefore, the MAC address table is prone to attacks. An attack can be in the form of unauthorized users sending a large number of packets, which are then recorded as MAC address entries. Also, when no MAC address entry is found for a packet, the packet is broadcast, consuming bandwidth resources and potentially causing broadcast storms. The device provides a wide variety of security mechanisms to protect MAC address tables, including <a href="../galaxy_stormsuppression_cfg_0001.html">storm suppression</a>.</li><li>Layer 3 network: Layer 3 data is forwarded based on the ARP table and routing table. The entries in the routing table are generated through routing protocol negotiation, so they are difficult to attack. The ARP entries are generated by protocol packet exchange. Attackers may send a large number of protocol packets or forged protocol packets to attack the ARP table. Therefore, the ARP table must be properly protected in Layer 3 forwarding. The device prevents the preceding attacks through <a href="../vrp_arp_security_cfg_0001.html">ARP security</a><span> and <a href="../galaxy_urpf_cfg_0001_22gp.html">URPF</a></span>.</li></ul>
