<h1 class="topicTitle-h1">Understanding Association Between VRRP and BFD</h1>
<div><div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Application Scenarios</h4><p>After a VRRP group is configured, VRRP devices negotiate the master/backup state through VRRP Advertisement packets. If an interface or a link fails, or the network topology changes, devices in the VRRP group cannot immediately detect the failure or change. Consequently, the master/backup VRRP switchover is delayed. Additionally, after a master/backup VRRP switchover is complete, route switching fails to be performed because no route is associated with the VRRP group, interrupting the normal forwarding of traffic.</p>
<p>To resolve these problems, configure VRRP association. If an object associated with a VRRP group fails, the VRRP group is notified and performs a primary/secondary link switchover. In addition, when a master/backup VRRP switchover is performed, the VRRP group instructs its associated object to perform a switchover accordingly. VRRP association ensures proper traffic forwarding and improves link reliability.</p>
<p>BFD is used to rapidly detect faults in links or IP routes. BFD for VRRP enables a master/backup VRRP switchover to be completed within 1 second, thereby preventing traffic loss. A BFD session is established between the master and backup devices in a VRRP group and is bound to the VRRP group. BFD immediately detects communication faults in the VRRP group and instructs the VRRP group to perform a master/backup switchover, minimizing service interruptions.</p>

If BFD detects a fault on the link between DeviceA and DeviceB, BFD notifies DeviceB to increase its VRRP priority so that it assumes the master role and forwards service traffic.</p>
<div class="fignone" id="EN-US_CONCEPT_0000001176743713__fig_dc_vrp_vrrp_feature_011004"><a name="EN-US_CONCEPT_0000001176743713__fig_dc_vrp_vrrp_feature_011004"></a><a name="fig_dc_vrp_vrrp_feature_011004"></a><span class="figcap"><b>Figure 1 </b>Network diagram of associating a VRRP group with a common BFD session</span><br><span><img class="vsd" src="figure/en-us_image_0000001176663829.png" width="NaN" height="NaN"></span></div>
<p>VRRP device configurations are as follows:</p>
<ul><li>DeviceA (master) works in delayed preemption mode and its VRRP priority is 120.</li><li>DeviceB (backup) works in immediate preemption mode and its VRRP priority is 100.</li><li>DeviceB in the VRRP group is configured to monitor a common BFD session. If BFD detects a fault and the BFD session goes down, DeviceB increases its VRRP priority by 40.</li></ul>
<p>The implementation is as follows:</p>
<ol><li>Normally, DeviceA periodically sends VRRP Advertisement packets to notify DeviceB that it is working properly. DeviceB monitors the status of DeviceA and the BFD session.</li><li>If BFD detects a fault, the BFD session goes down. DeviceB increases its VRRP priority to 140 (100 + 40 = 140), making it higher than DeviceA's VRRP priority. DeviceB then immediately preempts the master role and sends gratuitous ARP packets to allow DeviceE to update address entries.</li><li><p>The BFD session goes up after the fault is rectified. In this case:</p>
<p>DeviceB restores its VRRP priority to 100 (140 â 40 = 100). DeviceB remains in the Master state and continues to send VRRP Advertisement packets.</p>
<p>After receiving these packets, DeviceA checks that the VRRP priority carried in them is lower than the local VRRP priority and preempts the master role after the specified VRRP status recovery delay expires. DeviceA then sends VRRP Advertisement and gratuitous ARP packets.</p>
<p>After receiving a VRRP Advertisement packet that carries a priority higher than the local priority, DeviceB enters the Backup state.</p>
</li><li>Both DeviceA and DeviceB are restored to their original statuses. As such, DeviceA forwards user-to-network traffic again.</li></ol>
<p>The preceding process shows that association between VRRP and BFD differs from VRRP. Specifically, after a VRRP group is associated with a BFD session and a fault occurs, the backup device immediately preempts the master role by increasing its VRRP priority, and it does not wait for a period three times the interval at which VRRP Advertisement packets are sent. This means that a master/backup VRRP switchover can be performed in milliseconds.</p>

<p>DeviceA and DeviceB run VRRP. A peer BFD session is established between DeviceA and DeviceB to detect link and device faults.
