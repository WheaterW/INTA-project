<h1 class="topicTitle-h1">Understanding Routing Loop Detection for Routes Imported to OSPF</h1>
<div><p>Routes of an OSPF process can be redistributed by another OSPF process or the process of another protocol (such as IS-IS or BGP) through route import or default route distribution. However, if a device that performs such a route import or default route distribution is incorrectly configured, routing loops may occur. OSPF can use the routing loop detection function to detect routing loops.</p>
<div class="note"><img src="../public_sys-resources/note_3.0-en-us.png"><span class="notetitle"> </span><div class="notebody"><p>When OSPF is configured to import routes or distribute default routes, routing loop detection can be deployed to proactively detect whether routing loops exist in the topology and whether the routing loop prevention mechanism of the import route-policy takes effect. Routing loop alarms can be reported to locate configuration errors in time.</p>
<p>Generally, routing loop detection is not used to resolve routing loops. Increasing the metric value or adjusting the route preference value after a routing loop alarm is reported can temporarily prevent loops but may cause the traffic to be forwarded in an unexpected path. Therefore, loop detection can only be used temporarily. To eliminate routing loops in the long run, re-plan the network configuration.</p>

<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Related Concepts</h4><p><strong>Redistribute ID</strong></p>
<p>IS-IS uses a system ID as a redistribution identifier, OSPF and OSPFv3 use a router ID + process ID as a redistribution identifier, and BGP uses a VrfID + random number as a redistribution identifier. For ease of understanding, the redistribution identifiers of different protocols are all called Redistribute IDs. When routes are distributed, the information carried in the routes contains Redistribute IDs.</p>
<p><strong>Redistribute List</strong></p>
<p>A Redistribute list may consist of multiple Redistribute IDs. Each Redistribute list of BGP contains a maximum of four Redistribute IDs, and each Redistribute list of any other routing protocol contains a maximum of two Redistribute IDs. When the number of Redistribute IDs exceeds the corresponding limit, the old ones are discarded according to the sequence in which Redistribute IDs are added.</p>

<p>Currently, OSPF allows a TLV to carry a maximum of two Redistribute IDs. If more than two routes are imported corresponding to a prefix, only the latest two Redistribute IDs are retained. If the received TLV carries more than two Redistribute IDs, only the first two Redistribute IDs are processed.</p>

DeviceD imports routes from OSPF process 1 to OSPF process 2 for distribution. DeviceE imports the routes from OSPF process 2 to OSPF process 1. In this case, the routes are re-distributed back to OSPF process 1. As the costs of the routes newly distributed by DeviceE are smaller, they are preferentially selected by OSPF process 1, resulting in routing loops.</p>
<div class="fignone" id="EN-US_CONCEPT_0000001165821874__fig28588511242"><a name="EN-US_CONCEPT_0000001165821874__fig28588511242"></a><a name="fig28588511242"></a><span class="figcap"><b>Figure 2 </b>Typical network diagram of OSPF inter-process mutual route import</span><br><span><img class="imgResize" src="figure/en-us_image_0000001187712440.png" width="523.6875" height="197.95746599999998" title="Click to enlarge"></span></div>
<p>Take the route distributed by DeviceA as an example. A stable routing loop is formed through the following process:</p>
<p><strong>Phase 1</strong></p>
<p>On the network shown in <a href="#EN-US_CONCEPT_0000001165821874__fig32561325134118">Figure 3</a>, OSPF process 1 on DeviceA imports the static route 10.0.0.1 and floods a Type 5 AS-External-LSA in OSPF process 1. After receiving the LSA, OSPF process 1 on DeviceD and OSPF process 1 on DeviceE each calculate a route to 10.0.0.1, with the outbound interfaces being interface1 on DeviceD and interface1 on DeviceE, respectively, and the cost being 102. At this point, the routes to 10.0.0.1 in OSPF process 1 in the routing tables of DeviceD and DeviceE are active.</p>
<div class="fignone" id="EN-US_CONCEPT_0000001165821874__fig32561325134118"><a name="EN-US_CONCEPT_0000001165821874__fig32561325134118"></a><a name="fig32561325134118"></a><span class="figcap"><b>Figure 3 </b>Phase 1</span><br><span><img class="imgResize" src="figure/en-us_image_0000001187552462.png" width="523.6875" height="181.70260500000003" title="Click to enlarge"></span></div>
<p><strong>Phase 2</strong></p>
<p>In <a href="#EN-US_CONCEPT_0000001165821874__fig647512502514">Figure 4</a>, DeviceD is configured to import routes from OSPF process 1 to OSPF process 2, and DeviceE is configured to import routes from OSPF process 2 to OSPF process 1. No route-policy is configured for the import, or the configured route-policy is improper.</p>
<p>OSPF process 2 on DeviceD imports routes from OSPF process 1 and then floods a Type 5 AS-External-LSA in OSPF process 2. After receiving the LSA, OSPF process 2 on DeviceE calculates a route to 10.0.0.1, with the cost being 2, which is smaller than that (102) of the route calculated by OSPF process 1. As a result, the active route to 10.0.0.1 in the routing table of DeviceE is switched from the one calculated by OSPF process 1 to the one calculated by OSPF process 2, and the outbound interface of the route is sub-interface2.1.</p>
<div class="fignone" id="EN-US_CONCEPT_0000001165821874__fig647512502514"><a name="EN-US_CONCEPT_0000001165821874__fig647512502514"></a><a name="fig647512502514"></a><span class="figcap"><b>Figure 4 </b>Phase 2</span><br><span><img class="imgResize" src="figure/en-us_image_0000001233310519.png" width="523.6875" height="182.993104" title="Click to enlarge"></span></div>
<p><strong>Phase 3</strong></p>
<p>In <a href="#EN-US_CONCEPT_0000001165821874__fig191141331165910">Figure 5</a>, DeviceE imports the route from OSPF process 2 to OSPF process 1 and floods a Type 5 AS-External LSA in OSPF process 1. After receiving the LSA, OSPF process 1 on DeviceD recalculates the route to 10.0.0.1. The cost of the route becomes 2, which is smaller than that of the previously calculated route. Therefore, the route to 10.0.0.1 in OSPF process 1 on DeviceD is changed to the route distributed by DeviceE, and the outbound interface is interface 2.</p>
<div class="fignone" id="EN-US_CONCEPT_0000001165821874__fig191141331165910"><a name="EN-US_CONCEPT_0000001165821874__fig191141331165910"></a><a name="fig191141331165910"></a><span class="figcap"><b>Figure 5 </b>Phase 3</span><br><span><img class="imgResize" src="figure/en-us_image_0000001188030906.png" width="523.6875" height="182.993104" title="Click to enlarge"></span></div>
<p><strong>Phase 4</strong></p>
<p>After the route to 10.0.0.1 on DeviceD is updated, OSPF process 2 still imports the route from OSPF process 1 because the route remains active, and continues to distribute/update a Type 5 AS-External-LSA.</p>
<p>As a result, a stable routing loop is formed. Assuming that traffic is injected from DeviceF, <a href="#EN-US_CONCEPT_0000001165821874__fig850684615511">Figure 6</a> shows the traffic flow when the routing loop occurs.</p>

<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Implementation (OSPF Inter-Process Mutual Route Import)</h4><p>Routing loop detection for the routes imported between OSPF processes can resolve the routing loops in the preceding scenario.</p>
<p>When distributing a Type 5 AS-External-LSA for an imported route, OSPF also uses a Type 11 extended prefix Opaque LSA to distribute to other devices the Redistribute ID of the device that redistributes the imported route. If the route is redistributed by different protocols through multiple devices, the Redistribute IDs of these protocols on the devices are distributed through a Type 11 extended prefix Opaque LSA. When receiving the Type 11 extended prefix Opaque LSA, a route calculation device saves the Redistribute ID and route information of the route redistribution device. When another process of a route calculation device imports the route, the device checks whether a routing loop occurs according to the route redistribution information. If a routing loop occurs, the device attaches a large route cost to the AS-External-LSA for the imported route so that other devices preferentially select other paths after learning the route. This prevents routing loops.</p>

For ease of understanding, the following section assumes that the original route cost is less than 10223715.</li><li>After the cost of a route distributed through an LSA is increased, the device does not proactively withdraw the routing loop state.

<p>On the network shown in <a href="#EN-US_CONCEPT_0000001165821874__fig1476519106207">Figure 7</a>, assume that the router ID of OSPF process 2 on DeviceD is 4.4.4.2 (the Redistribute ID is 0x0404040200000002) and that the router ID of OSPF process 1 on DeviceE is 5.5.5.1 (the Redistribute ID is 0x0505050100000001).</p>
<p>Routing loops are detected and resolved as follows:</p>
<ol><li>Through OSPF process 1, DeviceD learns the route 10.0.0.1/24 distributed by DeviceB, imports the route from OSPF process 1 to OSPF process 2, and adds Redistribute ID information to the route to be distributed through a Type 11 extended prefix Opaque LSA.</li><li>DeviceE learns the Redistribute ID information and saves it in its routing table.

When re-distributing the route, OSPF process 2 on DeviceD attaches a large cost (10223715) to the route in the AS-External LSA.</li><li>After learning the route, OSPF process 2 on DeviceE does not preferentially select it because of the large cost.

<ul><li>Routing loop detection is performed randomly. In the preceding process, it is assumed that DeviceD distributes a Redistribute ID and detects a routing loop first. In this case, DeviceD distributes a large route cost. If due to another time sequence, DeviceE distributes a Redistribute ID and detects a routing loop first, OSPF process 1 on DeviceE distributes a large route cost.</li><li>Distributing a large route cost does not necessarily resolve routing loops. For example, if routes are imported between two routing protocols, a route with a larger cost may be preferentially selected.</li><li>If routes are imported within a protocol on a device and the device detects a routing loop, it increases the cost of the route to be distributed. After the remote device learns this route with a large cost, it does not preferentially select this route as the optimal route in the IP routing table. In this manner, the routing loop is resolved. In the case of inter-protocol route import, if a routing protocol with a higher priority detects a routing loop, although this protocol increases the cost of the corresponding route, the cost increase will not render the route inactive. As a result, the routing loop cannot be eliminated. If the routing protocol with a lower priority detects a routing loop and increases the cost of the corresponding route, the originally imported route is preferentially selected. In this case, the routing loop can be eliminated.</li></ul>

<ol><li>DeviceD learns the route distributed by DeviceB through OSPF process 1 and imports the route from OSPF process 1 to IS-IS process 2.

At this time, the next hop of the route 10.0.0.1 in IS-IS process 2 on DeviceE is DeviceD.</li><li>DeviceE imports the route from IS-IS process 2 to OSPF process 1 and uses a Type 11 extended prefix Opaque LSA to distribute the Redistribute ID of OSPF process 1 on DeviceE when distributing route information.</li><li>Similarly, after OSPF process 1 on DeviceD learns the route from DeviceE, DeviceD saves the Redistribute ID distributed by OSPF process 1 on DeviceE to the routing table during route calculation.

<p>If routes are imported within a protocol on a device and the device detects a routing loop, it increases the cost of the route to be distributed.

<p>In the case of inter-protocol route import, if a routing protocol with a higher priority detects a routing loop, although this protocol increases the cost of the corresponding route, the cost increase will not render the route inactive.

If the routing protocol with a lower priority detects a routing loop and increases the cost of the corresponding route, the originally imported route is preferentially selected.

<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Cause (Mutual Route Import Between OSPF and BGP)</h4><p>On the network shown in <a href="#EN-US_CONCEPT_0000001165821874__fig199452121070">Figure 10</a>, DeviceA, DeviceB, and DeviceC run a BGP process, DeviceF and DeviceG run OSPF process 2, and DeviceD and DeviceE run both processes. A BGP peer relationship is established between DeviceD and DeviceE. DeviceD imports routes from BGP to OSPF process 2 for distribution. DeviceE imports routes from OSPF process 2 to BGP. In this case, the routes are re-distributed back to BGP. Because no route-policy is configured for the import or the configured route-policy is improper, the route newly distributed by DeviceE may be selected as the optimal route by BGP, causing a routing loop.</p>

<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Implementation (Mutual Route Import Between OSPF and BGP)</h4><p>Redistribute IDs of BGP routes are delivered to the IP routing table along with the routes. The IP routing table stores Redistribute IDs in a unified format. When OSPF imports the BGP routes, the processing of Redistribute IDs is the same as that in a scenario where routes are mutually imported between OSPF processes.</p>
