<h1 class="topicTitle-h1">Understanding VXLAN Tunnel Establishment in BGP EVPN Mode (Distributed VXLAN Gateway)</h1>
<div><p>In a BGP EVPN-based VXLAN tunnel establishment scenario where VXLAN gateways are deployed in distributed mode, the control plane is responsible for VXLAN tunnel establishment and dynamic MAC address learning, while the forwarding plane is responsible for intra-subnet known unicast packet forwarding, intra-subnet BUM packet forwarding, and inter-subnet packet forwarding. BGP EVPN provides various functions, including host IP route advertisement, host MAC address advertisement, and host ARP notification (<a href="dc_vrp_feature_vxlan_1034.html">EVPN VXLAN Fundamentals</a>). ARP broadcast suppression can be enabled directly. If VXLAN gateways are deployed in distributed VXLAN mode, BGP EVPN-based VXLAN tunnel establishment is recommended.</p>
<div class="p">The following uses IPv4 over IPv4 as an example. For implementation differences between IPv6 over IPv4 and IPv4 over IPv4, see <a href="#EN-US_CONCEPT_0000001176664071__table_01">Table 1</a>.

<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">VXLAN Tunnel Establishment</h4><p>A VXLAN tunnel is identified by a pair of VTEP IP addresses. During VXLAN tunnel establishment, the local and remote VTEPs attempt to obtain each other's IP addresses, and a VXLAN tunnel can be established if the VTEP IP addresses are reachable at Layer 3. When BGP EVPN is used to dynamically establish a VXLAN tunnel, the local and remote VTEPs first establish a BGP EVPN peer relationship and then exchange BGP EVPN routes to transmit VNIs and VTEPs' IP addresses.</p>
<p>In distributed VXLAN gateway scenarios, leaf nodes function as both Layer 2 and Layer 3 VXLAN gateways. Spine nodes are unaware of the VXLAN tunnels and only forward VXLAN packets between different leaf nodes. On the control plane, a VXLAN tunnel only needs to be established between leaf nodes. On the network shown in <a href="#EN-US_CONCEPT_0000001176664071__fig_dc_vrp_feature_vxlan_103901">Figure 1</a>, a VXLAN tunnel is established between Leaf1 and Leaf2 in order for Host1 and Host2 or Host3 and Host2 to communicate. Because Host1 and Host3 both connect to Leaf1, they can directly communicate through Leaf1 instead of over a VXLAN tunnel.</p>
<div class="fignone" id="EN-US_CONCEPT_0000001176664071__fig_dc_vrp_feature_vxlan_103901"><a name="EN-US_CONCEPT_0000001176664071__fig_dc_vrp_feature_vxlan_103901"></a><a name="fig_dc_vrp_feature_vxlan_103901"></a><span class="figcap"><b>Figure 1 </b>VXLAN tunnel establishment</span><br><span><img class="vsd" src="figure/en-us_image_0000001176664149.png" width="NaN" height="NaN"></span></div>
<p>In distributed gateway scenarios, BGP EVPN can be used to dynamically establish VXLAN tunnels in either of the following situations:</p>
<p><strong>Intra-Subnet Communication</strong></p>
<p>On the network shown in <a href="#EN-US_CONCEPT_0000001176664071__fig_dc_vrp_feature_vxlan_103902">Figure 2</a>, intra-subnet communication between Host2 and Host3 requires only Layer 2 forwarding. The process for establishing a VXLAN tunnel using BGP EVPN is as follows.</p>
<div class="fignone" id="EN-US_CONCEPT_0000001176664071__fig_dc_vrp_feature_vxlan_103902"><a name="EN-US_CONCEPT_0000001176664071__fig_dc_vrp_feature_vxlan_103902"></a><a name="fig_dc_vrp_feature_vxlan_103902"></a><span class="figcap"><b>Figure 2 </b>Dynamic VXLAN tunnel establishment (1)</span><br><span><img class="vsd" src="figure/en-us_image_0000001130624592.png" width="NaN" height="NaN"></span></div>
<ol><li><p>Configure Leaf1 and Leaf2 to establish a BGP EVPN peer relationship, configure Layer 2 BDs on Leaf1 and Leaf2, and then associate L2VNIs with the Layer 2 BDs. Create EVPN instances in the Layer 2 BDs, and configure RDs, export VPN targets (ERTs), and import VPN targets (IRTs) for the EVPN instances. After the local VTEP IP address is configured on Leaf1 and Leaf2, they generate a BGP EVPN route and send it to each other. This BGP EVPN route carries the local EVPN instance's ERT and an inclusive multicast route (Type 3 route defined in BGP EVPN). <a href="#EN-US_CONCEPT_0000001176664071__fig_dc_vrp_feature_vxlan_103303">Figure 3</a> shows the format of an inclusive multicast route, which is comprised of a prefix and a PMSI attribute. VTEP IP addresses are stored in the Originating Router's IP Address field in the inclusive multicast route prefix, and L2VNIs are stored in the MPLS Label field in the PMSI attribute.</p>
<div class="fignone" id="EN-US_CONCEPT_0000001176664071__fig_dc_vrp_feature_vxlan_103303"><a name="EN-US_CONCEPT_0000001176664071__fig_dc_vrp_feature_vxlan_103303"></a><a name="fig_dc_vrp_feature_vxlan_103303"></a><span class="figcap"><b>Figure 3 </b>Format of an inclusive multicast route</span><br><span><img class="vsd" src="figure/en-us_image_0000001176744077.png" width="NaN" height="NaN"></span></div>
</li><li><p>After receiving the BGP EVPN route from each other, Leaf1 and Leaf2 match the ERT of the route against the IRT of the local EVPN instance. If a match is found, the route is accepted; otherwise, it is discarded. After the route is accepted, Leaf1 and Leaf2 obtain the peer VTEP IP address and Layer 2 VNI carried in the route. If the peer VTEP IP address is reachable, a VXLAN tunnel to the peer end is established. Moreover, the local end creates a VNI-based ingress replication list and adds the peer VTEP IP address to the list for BUM packet forwarding.</p>
</li></ol>
<div class="note"><img src="../public_sys-resources/note_3.0-en-us.png"><span class="notetitle"> </span><div class="notebody"><p>A VPN target is a BGP extended community attribute. An EVPN instance can have the IRT and ERT configured. The local EVPN instance's ERT must match the remote EVPN instance's IRT for EVPN route advertisement. Otherwise, VXLAN tunnels cannot be dynamically established. If only one end can successfully accept the BGP EVPN route, this end can establish a VXLAN tunnel to the other end, but cannot exchange data packets with it. The other end drops packets after confirming that there is no VXLAN tunnel to the source end.</p>
<p>In terms of BGP EVPN Type 2 and Type 3 routes, a device that has an all-zero Ethernet Tag ID cannot interoperate with another device that has a non-zero Ethernet Tag ID.</p>
</div></div>
<p><strong>Inter-Subnet Communication</strong></p>
<p>Inter-subnet communication between Host1 and Host2 requires Layer 3 forwarding. When VXLAN tunnels are established using BGP EVPN, Leaf1 and Leaf2 must advertise host IP routes. Typically, 32-bit host IP routes are advertised. As different leaf nodes may connect to the same VXLAN segment, the network segment routes advertised by the leaf nodes may conflict, impacting host reachability. Leaf nodes can advertise network segment routes in the following scenarios:</p>
<ul><li><p>The network segment that a leaf node connects to is unique on a VXLAN, and a large number of specific host routes are available. In this case, the routes of the network segment to which the host IP routes belong can be advertised so that leaf nodes are not required to store all these routes.</p>
</li><li><p>When hosts on a VXLAN need to access external networks, leaf nodes can advertise routes destined for the external networks onto the VXLAN to allow other leaf nodes to learn the routes.</p>
</li></ul>
<p>Before establishing a VXLAN tunnel, perform the configurations listed in the following table on Leaf1 and Leaf2.</p>

</div>
<p>Dynamic VXLAN tunnel establishment varies according to how host IP routes are advertised.</p>
<ul><li><p>Host IP routes are advertised through IRB routes, as shown in <a href="#EN-US_CONCEPT_0000001176664071__fig_dc_vrp_feature_vxlan_103903">Figure 4</a>.</p>

<ol><li><p>When Host1 communicates with Leaf1 for the first time, Leaf1 learns the ARP entry of Host1 after receiving dynamic ARP packets. Leaf1 then finds the L3VPN instance bound to the VBDIF interface of the Layer 2 BD where Host1 resides, and obtains the L3VNI associated with the L3VPN instance. The EVPN instance of Leaf1 then generates an IRB route based on the information obtained. <a href="#EN-US_CONCEPT_0000001176664071__fig_dc_vrp_feature_vxlan_103904">Figure 5</a> shows the IRB route.

</li><li><p>After Leaf2 receives the BGP EVPN route from Leaf1, Leaf2 processes the route as follows:</p>
<ul><li>If the ERT carried in the route is the same as the IRT of the local EVPN instance, the route is accepted. After the EVPN instance obtains IRB routes, it can extract ARP routes from the IRB routes to implement ARP advertisement.</li><li><p>If the ERT carried in the route is the same as the eIRT of the local L3VPN instance, the route is accepted. The L3VPN instance then obtains the IRB route carried in the route, extracts the host IP address and L3VNI of Host1, and saves the host IP route of Host1 to the routing table. The outbound interface is obtained through recursion based on the next hop of the route, and the final recursion result is the VXLAN tunnel to Leaf1, as shown in <a href="#EN-US_CONCEPT_0000001176664071__fig_dc_vrp_feature_vxlan_103907">Figure 6</a>.</p>

<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Dynamic MAC Address Learning</h4><p>VXLAN supports dynamic MAC address learning to facilitate communication between end tenants. With this function enabled, MAC address entries are dynamically created and do not require manual maintenance, greatly reducing the maintenance workload. In distributed VXLAN gateway scenarios, inter-subnet communication requires Layer 3 forwarding; MAC address learning is implemented using dynamic ARP packets between the local host and gateway. The following example illustrates dynamic MAC address learning for intra-subnet communication of hosts on the network shown in <a href="#EN-US_CONCEPT_0000001176664071__fig_dc_vrp_feature_vxlan_103703">Figure 11</a>.</p>

<ol><li><p>Host3 sends dynamic ARP packets when first communicating with Leaf1. Leaf1 learns Host3's MAC address and the mapping between the BDID and packet inbound interface (that is, the physical interface Port 1 corresponding to the Layer 2 sub-interface). It then generates a MAC address entry relating to Host3 in the local MAC address table, with the outbound interface being Port 1. Leaf1 also generates a BGP EVPN route based on Host3's ARP entry and sends it to Leaf2. The BGP EVPN route carries the local EVPN instance's ERT, Next_Hop attribute, and a Type 2 route (MAC/IP route) defined in BGP EVPN. The Next_Hop attribute carries the local VTEP's IP address, while the MAC Address Length and MAC Address fields identify Host3's MAC address. The L2VNI is stored in the MPLS Label1 field. <a href="#EN-US_CONCEPT_0000001176664071__fig_dc_vrp_feature_vxlan_103305">Figure 12</a> shows the format of a MAC/IP route.</p>

</li><li><p>After receiving the BGP EVPN route from Leaf1, Leaf2 matches the ERT of the EVPN instance carried in the route against the IRT of the local EVPN instance. If a match is found, the route is accepted; otherwise, it is discarded. After accepting the route, Leaf2 obtains Host3's MAC address and the mapping between the BDID and the VTEP IP address (Next_Hop attribute) of Leaf1. It then generates the MAC address entry of Host3 in the local MAC address table. The recursion to the outbound interface must be performed based on the next hop, and the final recursion result is the VXLAN tunnel destined for Leaf1.</p>
</li></ol>
<p>Leaf1 learns the MAC route of Host2 through a similar process.</p>
<p>When Host3 communicates with Host2 for the first time, Host3 sends an ARP request for Host2's MAC address. The ARP request carries a destination MAC address containing all Fs and a destination IP address being IP2. By default, Leaf1 broadcasts the ARP request onto the network segment after receiving it. To reduce broadcast packets, ARP broadcast suppression can be enabled on Leaf1. If ARP broadcast suppression is enabled and Leaf1 receives the ARP request, Leaf1 checks whether it has Host2's MAC address based on the destination IP address of the ARP request. If Leaf1 has Host2's MAC address, it replaces the destination MAC address of the ARP request with Host2's MAC address and unicasts the ARP request to Leaf2 through the VXLAN tunnel. Upon receipt, Leaf2 forwards the ARP request to Host2, which then learns Host3's MAC address and responds with an ARP reply in unicast mode. After Host3 receives the ARP reply, it learns Host2's MAC address. At this point, Host3 and Host2 have learned each other's MAC address, and can communicate in unicast mode.</p>

<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Intra-Subnet BUM Packet Forwarding</h4><p>Intra-subnet BUM packets are forwarded between Layer 2 VXLAN gateways only, and are invisible to Layer 3 VXLAN gateways. Such packets can be forwarded in ingress replication, multicast replication, or centralized replication mode.</p>
<p><strong>Ingress Replication</strong></p>
<div class="p">In ingress replication mode, after a BUM packet enters a VXLAN tunnel, the ingress VTEP performs VXLAN encapsulation based on the ingress replication list and forwards the packet to all egress VTEPs in the list. When the BUM packet leaves the VXLAN tunnel, it is decapsulated by the egress VTEPs. <a href="#EN-US_CONCEPT_0000001176664071__fig_dc_vrp_feature_vxlan_103307">Figure 14</a> shows the forwarding process of a BUM packet in ingress replication mode.<div class="fignone" id="EN-US_CONCEPT_0000001176664071__fig_dc_vrp_feature_vxlan_103307"><a name="EN-US_CONCEPT_0000001176664071__fig_dc_vrp_feature_vxlan_103307"></a><a name="fig_dc_vrp_feature_vxlan_103307"></a><span class="figcap"><b>Figure 14 </b>Intra-subnet forwarding process of a BUM packet in ingress replication mode</span><br><span><img class="vsd" src="figure/en-us_image_0000001130624612.png" width="NaN" height="NaN"></span></div>

Specifically, Leaf2/Leaf3 finds the outbound interfaces and encapsulation information not related to the VXLAN tunnel, adds VLAN tags to the packet, and forwards the packet to TerminalB/TerminalC. </li></ol>

</div></div>
</div>
<p><strong>Centralized Replication</strong></p>
<div class="p">In ingress replication mode, when a BUM packet enters a VXLAN tunnel, the ingress VTEP must send a copy of the packet to each remote VTEP, flooding traffic on the network. Configuring centralized replication can resolve this issue. In centralized replication mode, the centralized replication function is configured on the ingress VTEP, and the flood proxy IP address is configured on the centralized replicator. When a BUM packet enters a VXLAN tunnel, the ingress VTEP only needs to send one copy of the packet to the centralized replicator, reducing flooded traffic on the network. The centralized replicator, also known as the flood gateway, decapsulates and encapsulates the BUM packet and sends it to each egress VTEP. When the BUM packet leaves the VXLAN tunnel, it is decapsulated by the egress VTEPs. <a href="#EN-US_CONCEPT_0000001176664071__fig_dc_dc_feature_vxlan_103910">Figure 15</a> shows the forwarding process of a BUM packet in centralized replication mode.<div class="note"><img src="../public_sys-resources/note_3.0-en-us.png"><span class="notetitle"> </span><div class="notebody"><p>Centralized replication takes precedence over ingress replication.

</div></div>
</div>
<p><strong>Multicast Replication</strong></p>
<div class="p">To reduce flooded traffic caused by the use of ingress replication to send BUM packets, you can also configure multicast replication. In multicast replication mode, all VTEPs with the same VNI join the same multicast group. A multicast routing protocol, such as PIM, is used to create a multicast forwarding entry for the multicast group. When the source VTEP receives a BUM packet, it adds a multicast destination IP address, such as 225.0.0.1, to the BUM packet before sending the packet to the remote VTEPs based on the created multicast forwarding entry, reducing flooded packets. The remote VTEPs decapsulate the VXLAN packet. <a href="#EN-US_CONCEPT_0000001176664071__fig_dc_dc_feature_vxlan_103911">Figure 16</a> shows the forwarding process of a BUM packet in multicast replication mode.<div class="fignone" id="EN-US_CONCEPT_0000001176664071__fig_dc_dc_feature_vxlan_103911"><a name="EN-US_CONCEPT_0000001176664071__fig_dc_dc_feature_vxlan_103911"></a><a name="fig_dc_dc_feature_vxlan_103911"></a><span class="figcap"><b>Figure 16 </b>Forwarding process of an intra-subnet BUM packet in multicast replication mode</span><br><span><img class="vsd" src="figure/en-us_image_0000001218196483.png" width="NaN" height="NaN"></span></div>
