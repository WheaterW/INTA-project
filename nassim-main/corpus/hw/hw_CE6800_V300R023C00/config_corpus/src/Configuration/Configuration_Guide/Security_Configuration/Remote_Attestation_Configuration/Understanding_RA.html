<h1 class="topicTitle-h1">Understanding RA</h1>
<div><div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">RA Fundamentals</h4><p>The remote attestation (RA) system consists of the baseline file, RA server, RA client, and CA. The administrator manages the entire RA system, including downloading the baseline file and applying for and uploading the CA certificate, as shown in <a href="#EN-US_CONCEPT_0000001513154906__fig61100141132">Figure 1</a>.</p>
<div class="fignone" id="EN-US_CONCEPT_0000001513154906__fig61100141132"><a name="EN-US_CONCEPT_0000001513154906__fig61100141132"></a><a name="fig61100141132"></a><span class="figcap"><b>Figure 1 </b>RA system architecture</span><br><span><img class="vsd" src="figure/en-us_image_0000001564115017.png" width="NaN" height="NaN"></span></div>
<ul><li>Baseline file: provided for the RA server. The baseline file contains the reference values of measurement objects and serves as the reference baseline for RA challenges. It is used to verify the SML obtained from the RA client for verifying the trust status of the RA client. Baseline files are protected by digital signatures and uploaded to the Huawei technical support website. Baseline file name: <i><span class="varname">product-name</span></i>_<i><span class="varname">version</span></i>_RABASE.tar.gz.<p>The SML is generated by the RA client and records the actual hash value and measurement sequence of a measurement object.</p>
</li><li>RA server: provides an RA web UI for users to log in. The RA server, as the core component of RA, sends a challenge request to the RA client, collects the PCR value and SML of the RA client, and verifies the trust status of the RA client based on the baseline file.</li><li>RA client: refers to a network device whose trust status is to be verified. The RA client is equipped with an HTM chip and supports trusted boot. It responds to the challenge request from the RA server and sends its PCR values and SML to the RA server.</li><li>CA: creates and issues certificates. It is an authoritative organization trusted by users. To authenticate the RA client and prevent it from being forged, the CA issues an attestation key (AK) certificate to the RA client.</li></ul>
<p>The RA client's AK certificate can be categorized into two types: initial attestation key (IAK) and local attestation key (LAK).</p>
<ul><li><p>IAK: an AK set in the HTM chip before delivery. It is used to sign the data (such as the PCR value) generated by the HTM. An IAK certificate is configured on the device before delivery. Therefore, you do not need to apply for a CA certificate.</p>
</li><li><p>LAK: an AK created locally by a user after the device is delivered. It is used to sign the data (such as the PCR value) generated by the HTM. The user can then apply for an LAK certificate from the CA through the PKI.</p>
</li></ul>
</div>
<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Working Process</h4><p>In the trusted boot phase, the device's binary programs such as the BIOS, BootLoader, and OS are measured during the boot process. A measurement is a one-way hash calculation of measurement objects (such as software packages and program files in software packages). The measurement result is saved in the PCRs (PCR values) of the HTM chip, and the measurement sequence is also recorded in the SML. The measurement result changes if either the measured file or measurement sequence changes. RA calculates the actual status of a device based on the PCR values and SML obtained during device boot, and compares the actual status with the reference values in the baseline file to determine whether the device is trusted.</p>
<p>In the trusted boot phase, the RA client calculates the hash value of each booted component and saves the values to its PCRs. The RA server (challenger) periodically sends a challenge to the RA client, requesting its PCR values and SML saved during the trusted boot phase. Baseline files downloaded from <strong>https://support.huawei.com</strong> are loaded on the RA server in advance. These baseline files contain reference values of each measurement object. After receiving the PCR values and SML from the RA client, the RA server uses the PCR value to verify the SML. If the verification is successful, the RA server compares the actual hash values of the measurement objects in the SML with the reference values in the baseline file and determines the trust status of the device based on the comparison result. If the actual hash values of all measurement objects in the SML match those in the baseline file, the RA client is trusted. Otherwise, the RA client is untrusted.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Verification Process</h4><p>The AK certificate of the RA client can be IAK or LAK. If you use the LAK certificate, you need to configure the RA client to obtain the LAK certificate first. For details, see <a href="galaxy_ra_cfg_0006.html">Configuring RA</a>.</p>
<p>The RA function between the RA server and RA client can be implemented only after the administrator completes the following tasks:</p>
<ol><li>Downloads the baseline file, Huawei root certificate, and Huawei level-2 CA certificate from the Huawei technical support website. If the RA client uses the LAK certificate, you also need to obtain the CA certificate chain that issues the LAK certificate.</li><li>Logs in to the RA server in web mode and uploads the files prepared in step 1 to the RA server.</li><li>Adds the device information about the RA client to the RA server, including the IP address and port number.</li><li>Verifies the network connectivity between the RA client and RA server to ensure that the former can be managed by the latter after being powered on. The RA client and RA server communicate with each other through NETCONF.</li></ol>
<p>When the RA client and RA server can reach each other over the network, the RA server can use the RA function to verify the trust status of the RA client. <a href="#EN-US_CONCEPT_0000001513154906__fig625183175615">Figure 2</a> illustrates the RA process.</p>
<div class="fignone" id="EN-US_CONCEPT_0000001513154906__fig625183175615"><a name="EN-US_CONCEPT_0000001513154906__fig625183175615"></a><a name="fig625183175615"></a><span class="figcap"><b>Figure 2 </b>RA process</span><br><span><img class="vsd" src="figure/en-us_image_0000001512675810.png" width="NaN" height="NaN"></span></div>
<ol><li>The RA server collects device information from the RA client, including product, HTM vendor, and version information. The collected information is used to manage the RA client and verify its trust status.</li><li>The RA client sends its device information, including the product name and version, device serial number, HTM specification version, HTM vendor, and HTM status, to the RA server.</li><li>The RA server sends a challenge request to the RA client and collects the PCR value and AK certificate specified on the RA client.</li><li>After receiving the challenge request from the RA server, the RA client interacts with the HTM to obtain the corresponding PCR value and AK certificate.<p>The RA client returns different certificate content to the RA server based on the specified AK certificate type:</p>
<ul><li><p>If the specified AK certificate type is IAK, the RA client returns the IAK certificate to the RA server.</p>
</li><li><p>If the specified AK certificate type is LAK, the RA client returns the LAK certificate and IAK certificate to the RA server.</p>
</li></ul>
</li><li>The RA client returns the AK certificate and PCR value to the RA server. The RA server verifies the AK certificate and PCR value.<ol type="a"><li>Uses the trust certificate configured on the RA server to verify whether the AK certificate is trusted. If the verification is successful, the RA server proceeds to the next step. Otherwise, the RA server sets the RA client's status to untrusted.</li><li>Uses the public key in the AK certificate to verify the PCR value. If the verification is successful, the RA server proceeds to the next step. Otherwise, the RA server sets the RA client's status to untrusted.</li></ol>
</li><li>The RA server requests the SML recorded by the RA client.</li><li>The RA client returns the recorded SML to the RA server, which then checks whether the RA client is trusted based on the received SML:<p>The RA server uses the PCR value in step 5 to verify the SML. If the verification is successful, the RA server compares the actual hash values of the measurement objects in the SML with the reference values in the baseline files and determines the trust status of the RA client based on the comparison result. If the actual hash values of all measurement objects in the SML match those in the baseline file, the RA client status is set to trusted. Otherwise, the RA client status is set to untrusted.</p>
