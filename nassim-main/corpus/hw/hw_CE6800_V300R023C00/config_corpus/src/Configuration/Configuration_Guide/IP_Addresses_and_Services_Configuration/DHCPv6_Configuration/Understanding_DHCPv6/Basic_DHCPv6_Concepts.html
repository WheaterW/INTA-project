<div><div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">IPv6 Address Allocation Methods</h4><p>Currently, the following methods are available to allocate IPv6 addresses:</p>
<ul><li>Manual configuration. IPv6 addresses/prefixes and other network configuration parameters are manually configured, such as the DNS, network information service (NIS), and Simple Network Time Protocol (SNTP) server addresses.</li><li>Stateless address autoconfiguration. Hosts generate link-local addresses based on interface IDs and automatically configure IPv6 addresses based on prefixes carried in RA messages.</li><li>Stateful address autoconfiguration using DHCPv6. DHCPv6 involves the following scenarios:<ul><li>DHCPv6 stateful address autoconfiguration. A DHCPv6 server automatically allocates IPv6 addresses/prefixes and other network configuration parameters, such as the DNS, NIS, and SNTP server addresses.</li><li>DHCPv6 stateless address autoconfiguration. Host IPv6 addresses are automatically generated through RA messages. A DHCPv6 server allocates other configuration parameters such as the DNS, NIS, and SNTP server addresses except for IPv6 addresses.</li></ul>
</li></ul>

<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">DHCPv6 Architecture</h4><p><a href="#EN-US_CONCEPT_0000001513170394__fig_dc_fd_dhcpv6_000401">Figure 1</a> shows the DHCPv6 architecture, which consists of the following three roles.</p>
<div class="fignone" id="EN-US_CONCEPT_0000001513170394__fig_dc_fd_dhcpv6_000401"><a name="EN-US_CONCEPT_0000001513170394__fig_dc_fd_dhcpv6_000401"></a><a name="fig_dc_fd_dhcpv6_000401"></a><span class="figcap"><b>Figure 1 </b>DHCPv6 architecture</span><br><span><img class="vsd" src="figure/en-us_image_0000001564010677.png"></span></div>
<ul><li><strong>DHCPv6 client</strong><p>A DHCPv6 client applies to a DHCPv6 server for IPv6 addresses/prefixes and other network configuration parameters to configure its address.</p>
</li><li><strong>DHCPv6 server</strong><p>A DHCPv6 server processes requests for address allocation, lease extension, and release from a DHCPv6 client or a DHCPv6 relay agent, and allocates IPv6 addresses/prefixes and other network configuration parameters to the client.</p>
</li><li><strong>DHCPv6 relay agent</strong><p>A DHCPv6 relay agent relays DHCPv6 messages between a DHCPv6 client and server to help the client configure its address. If a DHCPv6 client and server reside on the same link, the client uses a link-local multicast address to obtain an IPv6 address/prefix and other configuration parameters from the server. If a DHCPv6 client and server reside on different links, a DHCPv6 relay agent must be used to forward DHCPv6 messages between the client and server. DHCPv6 relay allows a single DHCPv6 server to serve DHCPv6 clients on different links, reducing costs and facilitating centralized management.</p>
</li></ul>
<p>DHCPv6 also provides the DHCPv6 prefix delegation (PD) mechanism, which is used for prefix allocation. For details, see RFC 3633. <a href="#EN-US_CONCEPT_0000001513170394__fig_dc_fd_dhcpv6_000701">Figure 2</a> shows the DHCPv6 PD architecture. In addition to a DHCPv6 relay agent, DHCPv6 PD involves the following two roles.</p>
<div class="fignone" id="EN-US_CONCEPT_0000001513170394__fig_dc_fd_dhcpv6_000701"><a name="EN-US_CONCEPT_0000001513170394__fig_dc_fd_dhcpv6_000701"></a><a name="fig_dc_fd_dhcpv6_000701"></a><span class="figcap"><b>Figure 2 </b>DHCPv6 PD architecture</span><p><span><img class="vsd" src="figure/en-us_image_0000001564130509.png"></span></p>
</div>
<ul><li><strong>DHCPv6 PD client</strong><p>A DHCPv6 PD client interacts with a DHCPv6 PD server to obtain an IPv6 address prefix. The client then divides the obtained prefix (which is typically less than 64 bits long) into subnet segments with 64-bit prefixes and advertises the subnet segments to the user link directly connected to the IPv6 hosts through RA messages. In this way, the IPv6 hosts automatically configure addresses.</p>
</li><li><strong>DHCPv6 PD server</strong><p>A DHCPv6 PD server processes prefix allocation requests from a DHCPv6 PD client or relay agent and allocates an IPv6 prefix to the client.</p>
</li></ul>
</div>
<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">DHCPv6 Unique Identifier</h4><p>Each DHCPv6 server or client has a unique DHCPv6 unique identifier (DUID). A DHCPv6 server uses DUIDs to identify DHCPv6 clients, and a DHCPv6 client uses DUIDs to identify DHCPv6 servers.</p>
<p>The DUIDs of a DHCPv6 client and server are carried in the Client Identifier and Server Identifier options, respectively. The two options have the same format and are distinguished by the option-code field value.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Identity Association</h4><p>An identity association (IA) enables a DHCPv6 server and client to identify, group, and manage IPv6 addresses. Each IA consists of an identity association identifier (IAID) and associated configuration information.</p>
<p>A DHCPv6 client must associate at least one IA with each of its interfaces for which the client requests IPv6 addresses from a DHCPv6 server. The client uses the IAs associated with the interfaces to obtain configuration information from the server. Each IA must be associated with at least one interface.</p>
<p>An IAID identifies an IA and must be unique on a DHCPv6 client. IAIDs are not lost or changed because of factors such as a device restart.</p>
<p>In an IA, the configuration information consists of one or more IPv6 addresses along with the lifetimes T1 and T2. Each address in an IA has a preferred lifetime and a valid lifetime.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Multicast Addresses Used by DHCPv6</h4><div class="p">In DHCPv4, a DHCPv4 client locates DHCPv4 servers by broadcasting DHCPv4 messages. To prevent broadcast storms, IPv6 uses multicast messages instead of broadcast messages. DHCPv6 uses the following two multicast addresses:<ul><li>FF02::1:2: multicast address of all DHCPv6 servers and relay agents. The address is a link-local multicast address and is used for communication between a DHCPv6 client and its neighboring servers or between a DHCPv6 client and DHCPv6 relay agents. All DHCPv6 servers and relay agents are members of the multicast group corresponding to this multicast address.</li><li>FF05::1:3: multicast address of all DHCPv6 servers. The address is a site-local address and is used for communication between DHCPv6 relay agents and servers within a site. All DHCPv6 servers within a site are members of this multicast group.</li></ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">UDP Port Numbers Used by DHCPv6</h4><p>DHCPv6 messages are carried over UDPv6. The UDP port number that a DHCPv6 client listens to is 546, whereas a DHCPv6 server and relay agent listen to 547.</p>
