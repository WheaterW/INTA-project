<div><div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Definition</h4><p>Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) is the core protocol of the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)/IP protocol suite. All TCP, User Datagram Protocol (UDP) and Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) data is carried in IP datagrams. IPv4 works at the Internet layer of the TCP/IP model. This layer corresponds to the network layer in the OSI model. The network layer provides connectionless data transmission. Each IP datagram is transmitted independently without needing to establish a connection before IP datagrams are sent. A large number of datagrams need to be forwarded on the network, which may cause network congestion and degrade network performance. You can adjust parameters or forwarding modes for datagrams to improve network performance.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Purpose</h4><p>IP provides unreliable and connectionless data transmission services. Unreliable transmission means that IP does not ensure that IP datagrams successfully arrive at their destination. IP only provides best effort delivery. Once an error occurs, for example, a device exhausts the buffer, IP discards the excess datagrams and sends ICMP messages to the source. The upper-layer protocols, such as TCP, are responsible for resolving reliability issues.</p>
<p>Connectionless transmission means that IP does not maintain status information for subsequent datagrams. Every datagram is processed independently, meaning that IP datagrams may not be received in the same order they are sent. If a source sends two consecutive datagrams A and B in sequence to the same destination, each datagram is possibly routed over a different path, and therefore B may arrive ahead of A.</p>
<div class="p">Each host on an IP network must have an IP address. An IPv4 address is 32 bits long and consists of two parts: network ID and host ID.<ul><li><p>A network ID uniquely identifies a network segment or a group of network segments. A network ID can be obtained by converting an IP address and subnet mask into binary numbers and performing an AND operation on the numbers.</p>
</li><li><p>A host ID uniquely identifies a device on a network segment. A host ID can be obtained by converting an IP address and subnet mask into binary numbers, reversing the post-conversion subnet mask, and performing an AND operation on the numbers.</p>
</li></ul>
</div>
<p>Network devices with the same network ID are located on the same network, regardless of their physical locations.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Benefits</h4><p>IPv4 is used at the network layer to ensure proper data transmission between the data link and transport layers. IPv4 shields the differences at the data link layer and provides a uniform format for datagrams transmitted at the transport layer.</p>
