    "ExtraInfo": "Routing loops may occur when an OSPFv3 process imports routes. To prevent routing loops, run the route loop-detect ospfv3 enable command to enable loop detection for the imported routes. When a device detects that it has imported a route advertised by itself, it advertises a large cost for the route to other devices. After learning this route, other devices preferentially select another path, preventing routing loops."
