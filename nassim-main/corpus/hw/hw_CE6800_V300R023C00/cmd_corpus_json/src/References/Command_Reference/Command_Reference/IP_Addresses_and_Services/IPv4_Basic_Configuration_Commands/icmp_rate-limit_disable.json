    "ExtraInfo": "In normal situations, the router can correctly receive ICMP packets. In the case of heavy network traffic, if hosts or ports are frequently unreachable, the router receives a large number of ICMP packets, which causes heavier traffic burden and performance deterioration. In addition, network attackers often make use of ICMP error packets to probe the internal network structure.\nTo improve device performance and enhance network security, run the undo icmp rate-limit disable command to enable ICMP packet rate limiting."
