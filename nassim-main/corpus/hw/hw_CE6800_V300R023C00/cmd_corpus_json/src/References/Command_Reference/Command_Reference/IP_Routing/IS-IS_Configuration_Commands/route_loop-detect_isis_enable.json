    "ExtraInfo": "When an IS-IS process imports routes, routing loops may occur. To enable routing loop detection for routes imported into IS-IS, run the route loop-detect isis enable command. When a device detects that it has imported a route advertised by itself, the device advertises a large link cost for the route so that other devices can preferentially select another path after learning the route. This prevents routing loops."
