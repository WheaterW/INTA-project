The load-balance gtp teid command enables all Eth-Trunk interfaces on the device to perform load balancing for GTP packets based on the TEID field. The undo load-balance gtp teid command disables all Eth-Trunk interfaces on the device from performing load balancing for GTP packets based on the TEID field.
