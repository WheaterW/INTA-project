    "ExtraInfo": "If an ND entry is in the PROBE state, the neighbor is no longer known to be reachable. The device sends unicast NS messages to detect the validity of the ND entry. If a response is received from the neighbor, the ND entry enters the REACH state, indicating that the neighbor is known to have been reachable. If no response is received from the neighbor, the ND entry is deleted.\nYou are advised to run the ipv6 nd nud attempts command to set the number of probe retransmissions for ND entries in the PROBE state to a larger value in the following situations:"
