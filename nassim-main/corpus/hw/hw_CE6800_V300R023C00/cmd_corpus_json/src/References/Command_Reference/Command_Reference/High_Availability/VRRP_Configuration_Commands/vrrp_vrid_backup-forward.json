    "ExtraInfo": "On a mobile bearer network, a base station is connected to aggregation devices over the primary and secondary PWs and to NPEs over the active and standby links. A VRRP group is deployed on both NPEs. If the aggregation device on the active link fails, service traffic switches from the active link to the standby link immediately, but a master/backup VRRP switchover is performed between both NPEs after a delay. Therefore, service traffic is lost before the master/backup VRRP switchover is performed. To resolve this issue and meet carrier-class reliability requirements, run the vrrp vrid backup-forward command to enable the backup NPE to forward service traffic. After the configuration is complete, the backup NPE forwards service traffic before a master/backup VRRP switchover is performed, which prevents service traffic loss."
