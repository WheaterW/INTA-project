Route exchange between different OSPF processes is similar to that between different routing protocols.\nRouter IDs can be manually configured. If no router ID is specified using the command, OSPF uses the system ID or an interface IP address as the router ID.\nIn any of the following situations, router ID re-selection is performed:"
