    "ExtraInfo": "When hosts on the same network communicate, the MTU of the network is important to both communication ends. When hosts need to communicate across multiple networks, the smallest MTU on the communication path is most important to both ends. This is because different networks along the communication path have different link-layer MTUs. The minimum MTU on the communication path is called the path MTU.\nThe path MTU has the following characteristics:"
