    "ExtraInfo": "The FIN or RST flag in a TCP packet indicates that the TCP connection is terminated. When receiving a packet with the FIN or RST flag, the device immediately ages the corresponding NetStream flow. If this command is not run, NetStream flows are aged by following other criteria, for example, inactive aging time or bytes overflow."
