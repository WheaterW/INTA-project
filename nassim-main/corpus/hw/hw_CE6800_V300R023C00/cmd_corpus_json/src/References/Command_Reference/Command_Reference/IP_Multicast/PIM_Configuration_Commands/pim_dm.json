    "ExtraInfo": "A multicast network requires multicast protocols, and PIM is the most widely used intra-domain multicast protocol. PIM-DM is one of the implementations of PIM. PIM-DM resolves the problem of P2MP transmission on a small-scale network with many users.\nOn a PIM-DM network, the pim dm command must be run to enable PIM-DM. Only a device with PIM-DM enabled can set up PIM neighbor relationships with neighboring devices and process protocol packets received from them."
