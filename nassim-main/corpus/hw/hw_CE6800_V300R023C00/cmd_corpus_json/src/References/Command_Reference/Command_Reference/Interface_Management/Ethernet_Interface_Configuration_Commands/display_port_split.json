    "ExtraInfo": "Interface split allows a high-bandwidth physical interface on a device to be split into multiple independent low-bandwidth interfaces. You can choose to use the original high-bandwidth interface or split the interface into multiple low-bandwidth interfaces based on the interface type provided by the peer device. The interface split function improves networking flexibility and reduces device purchase costs.\nAfter an interface is split, you can run this command to check the current status of the split interface. In a port switching scenario, for example, a 100GE port is switched to a 200GE port, split information about the source port is retained."
