    "ExtraInfo": "To configure encryption algorithms on an SSH client, run the ssh client cipher command. The SSH client and server negotiate encryption algorithms for the packets exchanged between them. During negotiation, the client sends its encryption algorithms to the server. After comparing the received encryption algorithms with local ones, the server selects the first matching encryption algorithm received for packet transmission. If no matching encryption algorithm is found, the negotiation fails."
