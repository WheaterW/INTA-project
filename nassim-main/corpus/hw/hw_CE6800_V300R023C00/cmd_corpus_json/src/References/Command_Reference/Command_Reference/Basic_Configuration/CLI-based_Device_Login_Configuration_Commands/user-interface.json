    "ExtraInfo": "After a network administrator uses Telnet or SSH to log in to a device or logs in to a device through the console port, the system assigns a corresponding idle user interface with the smallest absolute or relative number for the network administrator to manage and monitor sessions between users and the device. One user interface corresponds to one user interface view. In a user interface view, the network administrator can set a range of parameters to specify whether login authentication is required, the level of a user after login, and other attributes. These parameter settings apply to all users logging in through this user interface, allowing user sessions to be managed in a centralized manner."
