    "ExtraInfo": "A 100GE interface can be split into four 25GE interfaces. When a 40GE 1-to-4 medium (for example, a 1-to-4 high-speed cable) is installed on the interface, the interface automatically works at the rate of four 10 Gbit/s. If a 100G 1-to-4 medium with variable rate is installed on a converted interface, run the port mode 10G command in the view of the converted interface to configure the converted interface to work at the rate of 10 Gbit/s.\nA 25GE interface can work at the rate of 25 Gbit/s, 10 Gbit/s, or 1 Gbit/s."
