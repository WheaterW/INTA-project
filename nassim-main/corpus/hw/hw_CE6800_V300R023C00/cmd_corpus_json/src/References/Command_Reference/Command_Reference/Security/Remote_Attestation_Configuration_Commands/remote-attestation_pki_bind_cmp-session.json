    "ExtraInfo": "Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) is a framework consisting of protocols and encryption algorithms. It provides multiple services, such as identity authentication, integrity protection, and confidentiality and access control.\nThe remote attestation function uses the PKI authentication mechanism and attestation identity key (AIK) certificates to check the reliability of devices. Run the remote-attestation pki bind cmp-session command to bind remote attestation to the created PKI CMP session. Then, the device applies for a local attestation key (LAK) certificate from the specified CA server through the bound session."
