    "ExtraInfo": "On a point-to-point network, devices at both ends of a link synchronize LSDBs with each other by flooding LSPs. The device at one end of the link sends an LSP. If the device at the other end receives this LSP, it replies with a PSNP. If the device that has sent an LSP does not receive a PSNP from the other end in a period of time, the device will retransmit the LSP.\nThe isis timer lsp-retransmit command is used to set an LSP retransmission interval. Only the devices on a point-to-point network send PSNPs. Therefore, the isis timer lsp-retransmit command will take effect only when it is run on point-to-point interfaces."
