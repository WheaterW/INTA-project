The peer local-graceful-restart timer restart command sets the maximum duration for a device to wait for the BGP peer relationship with a specified peer to be reestablished.

The local end must establish a connection with the peer within the configured maximum waiting time. Otherwise, the local end selects the optimal route from the existing routes."
