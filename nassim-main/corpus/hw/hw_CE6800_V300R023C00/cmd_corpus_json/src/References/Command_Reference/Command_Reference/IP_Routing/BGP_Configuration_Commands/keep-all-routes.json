    "ExtraInfo": "After the import policy of BGP is changed, you can reset the BGP connection for the new import policy to take effect immediately on the BGP peer that does not support route-refresh. This, however, interrupts the BGP connection temporarily. To solve this problem, run the keep-all-routes command to retain all the original routes of the peer. In this manner, the routing table can be refreshed without resetting the BGP connection."
