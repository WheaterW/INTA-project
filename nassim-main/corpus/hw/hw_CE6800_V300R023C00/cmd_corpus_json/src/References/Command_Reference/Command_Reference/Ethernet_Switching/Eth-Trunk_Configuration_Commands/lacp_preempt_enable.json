    "ExtraInfo": "After LACP priority preemption is enabled on Eth-Trunk interfaces in static LACP mode, Eth-Trunk interfaces always use interfaces with high priorities as active interfaces. For example, two devices are connected through three interfaces on each side. After the three interfaces are bundled into an Eth-Trunk interface, the mode lacp-static command is used to configure the Eth-Trunk interface to work in static LACP mode. If the maximum number of Up member interfaces is 2, the lacp priority command can be used in the interface view to set the LACP priorities of two member interfaces to 9 and 10, and the remaining interface uses the default LACP priority value 32768. Through LACP negotiation, the member interfaces with higher LACP priorities are selected as active interfaces, and the member interfaces with the default LACP priority are backup interfaces."
