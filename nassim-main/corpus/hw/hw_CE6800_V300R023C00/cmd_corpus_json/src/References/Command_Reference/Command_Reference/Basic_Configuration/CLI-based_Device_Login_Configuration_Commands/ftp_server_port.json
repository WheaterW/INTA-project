Attackers may access the default listening port, consuming bandwidth, deteriorating server performance, and causing authorized users unable to access the server. To improve security, run this command to change the listening port number of the FTP server. After that, attackers are deprived of information about the newly configured listening port number, and the FTP server is thus well protected.\nThe command ftp server port sets the FTP server listening port."
