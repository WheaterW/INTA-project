The local-preference enhanced command enables the function to preferentially forward traffic through a local chip. The undo local-preference enhanced command restores the default configuration. By default, the function to preferentially forward traffic through a local chip is not enabled. This command is supported only on the CE6863H, CE6863H-K, CE6881H and CE6881H-K.",

    "ExtraInfo": "If a device has multiple chips for traffic forwarding, the hash algorithm may select an inter-chip outbound interface, increasing the consumption of inter-chip bandwidth resources.\nTo resolve this issue, run this command so that traffic is preferentially forwarded from a local chip. Specifically, a chip preferentially forwards received traffic through its outbound interface. This effectively saves inter-chip bandwidth resources and improves the forwarding efficiency of traffic."
