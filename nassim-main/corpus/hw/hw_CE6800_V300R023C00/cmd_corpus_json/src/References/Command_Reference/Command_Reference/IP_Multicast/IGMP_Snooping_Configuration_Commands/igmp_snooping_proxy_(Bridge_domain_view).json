    "ExtraInfo": "Forwarding entries are set up based on IGMP messages exchanged between a Layer 3 device and user hosts. If there are many user hosts, redundant IGMP messages increase the workload of the Layer 2 device.\nIGMP Snooping Proxy can address this problem. IGMP Snooping Proxy provides two functions: querier function and uniform Report/Leave message transmission function. The querier function enables an IGMP Snooping Proxy-enabled device to replace the connected upstream device to send IGMP Query messages. The uniform Report/Leave message transmission function enables an IGMP Snooping Proxy-enabled device to process IGMP Report/Leave messages received from downstream user hosts. Configuring IGMP Snooping Proxy on a device effectively saves bandwidth between the device and the connected upstream device, and reduces the load of the connected upstream device."
