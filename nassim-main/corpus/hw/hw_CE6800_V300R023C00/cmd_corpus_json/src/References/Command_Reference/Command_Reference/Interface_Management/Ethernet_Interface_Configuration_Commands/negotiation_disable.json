    "ExtraInfo": "The earliest Ethernet interfaces worked in 10M half-duplex mode and required mechanisms such as Carrier Sense Multiple Access (CSMA)/Collision Detection (CD) to ensure system stability. As Ethernet technology develops, Ethernet interfaces can work in 100M and 1000M full-duplex mode. This greatly improves Ethernet performance. Auto-negotiation technology allows new Ethernet to be compatible with earlier Ethernet. In auto-negotiation mode, interfaces on both ends of a link negotiate their operating parameters, including the duplex mode and rate. If the negotiation succeeds, the two interfaces work at the same operating parameters."
