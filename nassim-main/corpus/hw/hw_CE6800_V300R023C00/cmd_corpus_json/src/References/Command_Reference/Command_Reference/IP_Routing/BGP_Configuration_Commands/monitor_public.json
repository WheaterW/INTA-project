    "ExtraInfo": "BMP is used to monitor BGP running status of devices in real time, such as the establishment and termination status of BGP peer relationships and route update status. To allow the BGP running status of all BGP peers in the public network address family to be monitored, run the monitor public command. After a TCP connection is established between a device and a monitoring server, the device reports BGP running status to the monitoring server, improving network monitoring efficiency."
