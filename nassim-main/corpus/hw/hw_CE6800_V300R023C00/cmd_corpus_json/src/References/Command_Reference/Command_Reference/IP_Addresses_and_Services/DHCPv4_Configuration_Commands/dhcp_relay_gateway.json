    "ExtraInfo": "Generally, you can configure the gateway address of an interface based on its primary/secondary IP address. By default, the primary IP address of an interface is used as the gateway address. If VRRP is enabled on an interface, run the dhcp relay gateway command on the interface to forcibly set the gateway address to the virtual IP address of the VRRP group."
