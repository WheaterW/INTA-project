    "ExtraInfo": "Before configuring a tunnel policy to select GRE tunnels as VPN tunnels, enable the Keepalive function for GRE tunnels to prevent a VPN from selecting an unreachable GRE tunnel as its tunnel. After configuring the Keepalive function, you can run the display keepalive packets count command to check the numbers of Keepalive messages and Keepalive response messages sent and received by a GRE tunnel interface.\nThe reset keepalive packets count command enables a device to re-collect statistics about Keepalive messages and Keepalive response messages, facilitating monitoring on the operating status of GRE tunnels."
