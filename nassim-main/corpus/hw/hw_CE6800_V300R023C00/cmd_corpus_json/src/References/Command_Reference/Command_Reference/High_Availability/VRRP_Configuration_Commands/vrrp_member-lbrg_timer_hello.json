    "ExtraInfo": "After a service VRRP group is configured as an LBRG, it does not periodically send gratuitous ARP packets (for VRRP4) or ND packets (for VRRP6) to update MAC entries on a downstream device. To prevent a master/backup switchover from occurring on the LBRG and ensure that the downstream device promptly updates MAC entries, the master device in the LBRG periodically sends VRRP Advertisement packets to update the MAC address of the downstream device.\nTo ensure that the MAC entries on the downstream device can be promptly updated, you can configure an interval at which the master device in the LBRG sends VRRP Advertisement packets to meet requirements for network reliability."
