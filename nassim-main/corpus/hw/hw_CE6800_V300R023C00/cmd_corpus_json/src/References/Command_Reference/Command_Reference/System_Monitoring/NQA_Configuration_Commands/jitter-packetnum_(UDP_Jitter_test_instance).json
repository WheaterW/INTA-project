    "ExtraInfo": "When a jitter test instance is used to monitor VoIP services, to set the number of the packets sent each time in a probe, run the jitter-packetnum command. The test simulates actual traffic within a specified period of time.\nThe jitter-codec command can also be used to simulate VoIP services. The jitter-packetnum command with a parameter configured, however, can implement more finely granular simulation. In addition, the jitter-packetnum command sets the number of packets to be sent for all services, which is widely applied."
