    "ExtraInfo": "Based on the LSDB, the device that runs OSPFv3 can calculate the Shortest Path Tree (SPT) with itself as the root based on the SPF algorithm, and determine the next hop to the destination network according to the SPT. When the OSPFv3 LSDB changes, the shortest path needs to be recalculated. Frequent network changes and SPF calculation consume many system resources and affect router performance. You can configure an intelligent timer and set a proper interval for the SPF calculation to prevent excessive router memory and bandwidth resources from being consumed.\nIf fast route convergence is required, you can set a millisecond-level interval to speed up route calculation. In other networking environments, the default value is recommended."
