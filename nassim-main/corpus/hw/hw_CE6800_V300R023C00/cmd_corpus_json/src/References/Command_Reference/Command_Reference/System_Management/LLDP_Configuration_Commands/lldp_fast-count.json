The lldp fast-count command sets the number of Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP) packets to be quickly sent to neighbors. The undo lldp fast-count command restores the default number of LLDP packets to be sent to neighbors. A device by default quickly sends four LLDP packets to its neighbors.",

    "ExtraInfo": "To help neighbors quickly obtain information about a local device, the local device sends a number of LLDP packets to neighbors when the local device discovers a new neighbor (that is, when the device receives an LLDP packet from a transmit device for which it has no information), or when LLDP is enabled for the device that previously had LLDP disabled, or the interface connected to a neighbor goes Up.\nYou can run the lldp fast-count command to set the number of LLDP packets to be quickly sent to neighbors to help neighbors quickly obtain information about the local device, and help the NMS quickly detect network topology."
