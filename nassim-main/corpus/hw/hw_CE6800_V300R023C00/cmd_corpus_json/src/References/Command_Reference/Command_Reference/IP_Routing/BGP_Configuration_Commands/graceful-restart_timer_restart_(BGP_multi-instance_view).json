    "ExtraInfo": "To set the maximum duration on a device for each peer to wait for its BGP peer relationship to be reestablished with the device, run the graceful-restart timer restart command. After this command is run, if any peer detects that the device is down, the BGP session on the peer enters the GR process. If the peer relationship is not reestablished within the specified duration, the BGP session exits the GR process, and the peer selects the optimal route among existing routes."
