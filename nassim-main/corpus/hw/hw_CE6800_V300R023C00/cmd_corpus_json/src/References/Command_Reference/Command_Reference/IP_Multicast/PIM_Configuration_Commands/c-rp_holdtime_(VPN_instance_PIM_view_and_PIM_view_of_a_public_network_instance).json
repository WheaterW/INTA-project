    "ExtraInfo": "After the c-rp holdtime command is run for a C-RP, the C-RP encapsulates interval in an Advertisement message and sends it to the BSR. The BSR obtains this interval from the message and starts the timer. If the BSR does not receive the Advertisement message from the C-RP after the timeout period expires, the BSR regards the C-RP invalid or unreachable."
