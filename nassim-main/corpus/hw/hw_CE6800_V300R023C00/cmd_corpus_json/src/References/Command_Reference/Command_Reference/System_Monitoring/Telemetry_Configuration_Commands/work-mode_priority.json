    "ExtraInfo": "After a destination group is created, you can run this command to set the working mode of the destination group to priority. In priority mode, the device establishes a telemetry connection with only one destination collector in the destination group.\nIf the working mode of a destination group is priority, the device first initiates a telemetry connection with the highest-priority destination collector in the destination group. If the connection fails, the device attempts to establish a telemetry connection with the second-priority destination collector, and so on and so forth. If the current connection is not of the highest priority, the device continuously attempts to establish a telemetry connection with a higher-priority destination collector.\nYou can run the ipv4-address port priority or ipv6-address port priority command to configure the priority of the destination collector. A device establishes a telemetry connection with a destination collector in descending order of priority: high > medium > low. If destination collectors have the same priority, they are first sorted based on the VPN name, then based on IP addresses (in ascending order), and finally based on port numbers (in ascending order)."
