    "ExtraInfo": "VNIs, similar to VLAN IDs, are used to differentiate VXLAN segments and identify tenants. A VNI identifies only one tenant. If multiple terminal users share the same VNI, they are considered one tenant. To create a global VNI and enter the VNI view, run the vni command. Then, global VNI configurations can be performed in the view."
