The lldp transmit delay command sets the delay time for a device to send Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP) packets. The undo lldp transmit delay command restores the default delay time. The default delay time is 2 seconds.",

    "ExtraInfo": "If the device status changes, a device sends LLDP packets to neighbors to notify the neighbors of its status change. If the device status changes frequently, the device will frequently send LLDP packets to its neighbors, causing network flapping.\nTo prevent network flapping caused by LLDP packets frequently sent to neighbors, set a delay time. To set the delay time for sending LLDP packets on a device, run the lldp message-transmission delay command."
