    "ExtraInfo": "To use a remote network management system (NMS) to manage devices in a centralized manner, configure a VLANIF interface on each device and use the interface IP address as the management IP address of the device. If a user connected to another interface of the device is added to the VLAN, the user can also access the switching device. This increases security risks on the switching device.\nAfter a VLAN is configured as a management VLAN, no access or dot1q-tunnel interface can be added to the VLAN. The access and dot1q-tunnel interfaces are usually used to connect users. If the access and dot1q-tunnel interfaces are not added to the management VLAN, users connected to the access and dot1q-tunnel interfaces cannot access the device. This improves the security of the switching device."
