    "ExtraInfo": "When Remaining Lifetime of an LSP is 0, the LSP is invalid, and this invalid packet is a Purge packet. In most cases, a Purge packet does not carry any information about the router that generated the Purge packet. Without such information, troubleshooting is difficult if a network problem occurs.\nTo address this issue, you can run the\npurge-originator-identification enable command to configure IS-IS to add POI TLV to Purge packets. If a dynamic hostname has been configured for the local device, the hostname TLV is also added to the Purge packets, which facilitates troubleshooting."
