    "ExtraInfo": "Enterprises or carriers need to generate revenue by charging users who are accessing the Internet.When a user goes online, accounting starts after the user is authenticated and authorized. When the user goes offline, accounting stops. The client sends the account packet containing the user's online duration to the accounting server.To charge users, set the accounting mode to RADIUS or HWTACACS. Generally, the accounting mode is consistent with the authentication mode. If you do not need to charge users, set the accounting mode to none."
