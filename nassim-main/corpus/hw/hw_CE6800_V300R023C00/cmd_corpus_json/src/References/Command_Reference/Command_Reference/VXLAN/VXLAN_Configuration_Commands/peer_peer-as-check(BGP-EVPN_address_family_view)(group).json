    "ExtraInfo": "By default, after receiving a route from an EBGP peer (for example, AS 200), the local device (for example, AS 100) advertises the route to all EBGP peers in AS 200. After the peer peer-as-check command is run on a device, the device does not advertise routes received from an EBGP peer to other EBGP peers in the same AS as this EBGP peer. This reduces BGP memory and CPU consumption and speeds up route convergence in case of route flapping."
