The dot1x send-packet untagged command enables an access device to remove VLAN tags from 802.1X packets to be sent to terminals. The undo dot1x send-packet untagged command disables an access device from removing VLAN tags from 802.1X packets to be sent to terminals. By default, access devices do not remove VLAN tags from 802.1X packets to be sent to terminals.

    "ExtraInfo": "Some terminals (mainly some models of IP phones) cannot identify the tagged 802.1X packets received from access devices, resulting in 802.1X authentication failures. To resolve this problem, you can run the dot1x send-packet untagged command to enable access devices to remove VLAN tags from 802.1X packets to be sent to terminals."
