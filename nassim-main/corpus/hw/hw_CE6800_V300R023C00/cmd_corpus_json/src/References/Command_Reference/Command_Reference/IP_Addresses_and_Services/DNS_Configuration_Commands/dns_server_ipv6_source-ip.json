    "ExtraInfo": "When the device functions as a DNS client, you can specify the source IPv6 address of the local device. The device uses the specified source IPv6 address to communicate with the DNS server with the IPv6 address to ensure security. The DNS server returns the request for a domain name to the local device along the specified route. If no source IPv6 address is configured, the source address is selected based on the destination address each time the client sends a DNS domain name request."
