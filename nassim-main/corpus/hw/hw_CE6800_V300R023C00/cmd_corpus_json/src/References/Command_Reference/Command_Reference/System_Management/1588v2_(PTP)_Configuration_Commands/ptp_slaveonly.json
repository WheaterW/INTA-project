The ptp slaveonly command configures an ordinary clock (OC) to work in slave-only mode. The undo ptp slaveonly command deletes the slave-only mode from the OC. By default, an OC can work as the master clock or a slave clock and does not work in slave-only mode.

    "ExtraInfo": "An OC has only a single 1588v2 interface. Therefore, the OC can only function as the master clock to advertise clock signals to downstream devices or as a slave clock to receive clock signals from upstream devices. To enable an OC to work only as a slave clock, run the ptp slaveonly command on the OC."
