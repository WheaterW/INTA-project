    "ExtraInfo": "In scenarios where hosts connected to a device do not send ARP messages proactively, to allow the device to proactively learn ARP entries of the hosts, enable ARP active detection on the device's interface. After this function is enabled, the device sends ARP probe messages to each host on the network segment where the device (gateway) address resides at the default or configured interval (1s by default). By default, a maximum of 128 ARP probe messages are sent in each interval. Alternatively, a configured number of ARP probe messages are sent in each interval. To configure an interval at which a device sends ARP probe messages and the number of ARP probe messages to be sent in each interval, run the arp smart-discover interval command. The IP addresses in the existing ARP entries, device IP addresses, and VRRP virtual IP addresses are not detected."
