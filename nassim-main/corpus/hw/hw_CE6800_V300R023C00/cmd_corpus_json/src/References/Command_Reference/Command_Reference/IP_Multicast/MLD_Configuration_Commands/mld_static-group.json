    "ExtraInfo": "If user hosts want to receive IPv6 multicast data for a Multicast Listener Discovery (MLD) group stably for a long time or to ensure that MLD group memberships on the user network segment are stable, run the mld static-group command to add the interface connected to user hosts to MLD groups statically. In this manner, the interface can fast respond to users' requests, thereby reducing the channel switch time."
