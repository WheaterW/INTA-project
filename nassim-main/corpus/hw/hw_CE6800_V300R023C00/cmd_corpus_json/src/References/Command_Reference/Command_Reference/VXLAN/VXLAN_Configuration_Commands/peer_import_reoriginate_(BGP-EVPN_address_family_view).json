    "ExtraInfo": "Data Center Interconnect (DCI) refers to the definition of various solutions for interconnecting data centers. In a DCI solution, a DCI-PE re-originates received EVPN routes before sending them to peers. By default, the function of re-originating labeled routes is disabled. That is, a DCI-PE does not re-encapsulate the routes received from peers. To enable a DCI-PE to re-encapsulate EVPN routes, run the peer import reoriginate command to enable the function of re-originating labeled routes.\nYou can query the BGP VPN routing table to check whether a route carries the REGEN capability flag in its attributes. If the route carries this flag, it can be re-originated and re-advertised to the BGP public network."
