The authentication password displayed in ciphertext is irreversible.\nWhen cipher is not entered, password input is in man-machine interaction mode, and the system does not display the entered password.The password is a string of 8 to 16 case-sensitive characters. The password must contain at least two of the following characters: upper-case character, lower-case character, digit, and special character.\nSpecial character except the question mark (?) and space. However, when double quotation marks are used around the password, spaces are allowed in the password.\nDouble quotation marks cannot contain double quotation marks if spaces are used in a password.Double quotation marks can contain double quotation marks if no space is used in a password.\nFor example, the password \"a123\"45\"\" is valid, but the password \"a 123\"45\"\" is invalid.When cipher is entered, the password is displayed in either plaintext or ciphertext during input.\n\nWhen being input in plaintext, the password requirements are the same as those when cipher is not entered. When you input a password in simple text, the system displays the password in simple text mode, which brings risks.When being input in ciphertext, the password must be a string of 48 to 128 consecutive characters.\nThe password is displayed in ciphertext in the configuration file regardless of whether it is input in plaintext or cipher text."
