    "ExtraInfo": "With the development of networks, Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) and on-line video services require high-quality real-time transmission. Nevertheless, if an IS-IS fault occurs, multiple processes, including fault detection, LSP update, LSP flooding, route calculation, and FIB entry delivery, must be performed to switch the traffic to a new link. As a result, it takes much more than 50 ms to rectify the fault, unable to meet the requirement for real-time services.\nThe frr-policy route command can be configured as required. In this case, the IS-IS backup route matching specified rules can be added to the IP routing table and delivered to the forwarding table. When a fault occurs on the route, the system can fast switch the forwarded traffic to the IS-IS backup route to protect the traffic.\nYou can use IP prefix lists or ACLs to filter the IS-IS backup routes."
