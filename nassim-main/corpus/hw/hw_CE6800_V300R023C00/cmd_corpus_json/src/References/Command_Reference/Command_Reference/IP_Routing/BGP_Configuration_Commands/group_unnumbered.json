    "ExtraInfo": "An unnumbered peer group is a group of peers that have the same policies. When a peer is added to a peer group, the peer obtains the same configuration as the peer group. The peers in a peer group can inherit the configurations of the peer group. When the configurations of the peer group change, the configurations of members in the peer group change accordingly.\nDuring network deployment based on the BGP unnumbered feature, unnumbered group configurations can be inherited to manage peers."
