    "ExtraInfo": "To prevent routing loops, the OSPF/OSPFv3 multi-instance process uses a bit as the flag bit, which is called the DN bit.\nIn a VPN Option A scenario, the local PE imports BGP routes to generate LSAs and advertises the LSAs to the remote PE. According to the standard protocol, the peer PE cannot calculate the route because the DN bit is suppressed. In this case, you can run the dn-bit-check disable command to disable the peer PE from checking the DN bit during route calculation."
