    "ExtraInfo": "After DHCP snooping is enabled, the device sends all the received DHCP Request messages and Reply messages to the processing unit. If the rate of sending DHCP messages is high, processing efficiency of the processing unit is affected. After the device is enabled to check the rate of sending DHCP messages to the processing unit, you can run the dhcp snooping check dhcp-rate command to set the maximum rate of sending DHCP messages to the processing unit. After the rate of sending DHCP messages to the processing unit exceeds the maximum rate, excess DHCP messages are discarded.\nThe configuration in the system view is used to check all packets on the device, the configuration in the interface view is used only for the interface, and the configuration in the VLAN view is used only for the VLAN. The configurations in the system view, interface view, and VLAN view are independent of each other."
