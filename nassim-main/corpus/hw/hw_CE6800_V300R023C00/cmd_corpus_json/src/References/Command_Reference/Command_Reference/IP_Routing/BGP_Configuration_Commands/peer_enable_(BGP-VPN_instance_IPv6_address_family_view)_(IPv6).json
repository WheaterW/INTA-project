The peer enable command enables a BGP device to exchange routes with a specified peer group in the address family view. The undo peer enable command disables a BGP device from exchanging routes with a specified peer group. By default, a device is disabled from exchanging routing information with a specified peer.

    "ExtraInfo": "By default, only peer groups in the BGP-IPv4 unicast address family are automatically enabled to exchange routing information. In other words, after the peer as-number command is run in the BGP view, the system automatically configures the peer enable command. In other address family views, however, this function must be manually enabled."
