    "ExtraInfo": "The keychain protocol can be used to periodically and dynamically change the authentication algorithm and key to ensure the security of protocol packet transmission without the need to manually change the algorithm and key. Each keychain consists of multiple key IDs, each of which has its own sending and receiving time. Different key IDs are active within a specified period.\nIf no send-key-id exists in the keychain or there is no active send-key-id in a certain period, the keychain cannot authenticate or encrypt protocol packets. As a result, the application protocol is disconnected due to an authentication failure. Configuring the default send-key-id ensures that the keychain uses this key ID to authenticate and encrypt protocol packets when no active key ID is available. This ensures normal communication of protocol packets."
