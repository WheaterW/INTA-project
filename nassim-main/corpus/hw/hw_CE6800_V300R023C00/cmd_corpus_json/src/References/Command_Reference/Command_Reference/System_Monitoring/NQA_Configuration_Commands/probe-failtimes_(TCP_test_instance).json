    "ExtraInfo": "An NQA test checks whether response packets are received in a probe.  If no response to a probe packet is received, the probe fails. When the number of consecutive probe failures in an NQA test instance reaches the specified threshold, a trap is sent to the NMS.\nThis command is used to set the number of consecutive probe failures, that is, the number of consecutive packet sending failures. The test-failtimes command is used to set the number of consecutive test failures. Multiple packets may be sent in a test, that is, a test may contain multiple probes."
