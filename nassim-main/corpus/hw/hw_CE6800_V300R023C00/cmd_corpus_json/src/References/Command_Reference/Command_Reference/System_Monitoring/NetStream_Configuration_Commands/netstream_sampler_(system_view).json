    "ExtraInfo": "After the NetStream function is enabled on an interface, the system stores the NetStream information in the corresponded interface information table. If every packet passing an interface is captured and counted, forwarding performance on the interface will deteriorate, especially on the interface with a high forwarding rate. To understand interface traffic attributes without compromising forwarding performance, configure packet sampling on the interface. A low sampling rate can significantly reduce impact of NetStream on device performance."
