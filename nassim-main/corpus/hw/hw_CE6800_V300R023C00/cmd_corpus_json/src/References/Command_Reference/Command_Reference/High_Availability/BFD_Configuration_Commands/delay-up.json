    "ExtraInfo": "In scenarios in which a Huawei device and a non-Huawei device are connected, if the Huawei device or its interface board restarts, traffic needs to be switched from an active link to a standby link. After the Huawei device or its interface board successfully restarts, the traffic needs to be switched from the standby link to the active link. In this case, the BFD session on the active link is Up. On certain non-Huawei devices, a link switchover is performed according to the BFD session status, the route to the Huawei devices may not be generated on the non-Huawei devices. As a result, traffic is dropped. To prevent this problem, the BFD session can be created and go Up through the negotiation after a delay."
