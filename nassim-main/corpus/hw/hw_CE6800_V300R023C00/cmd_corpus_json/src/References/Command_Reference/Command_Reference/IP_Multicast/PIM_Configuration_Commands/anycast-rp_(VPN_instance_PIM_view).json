    "ExtraInfo": "In a traditional Protocol Independent Multicast-Sparse Mode (PIM-SM) domain, all multicast groups map to one RP. When the network is overloaded or all traffic needs to be forwarded by only one RP, the RP may be overburdened. If the RP fails, routes are converged slowly, or multicast packets are forwarded over non-optimal paths.\nTo resolve this issue, run the anycast-rp command to configure an Anycast-RP in the PIM-SM domain, enabling the network to automatically select a topologically closest RP for each source and receiver. This function releases burdens on RPs, implements RP backup, and optimizes forwarding paths.\nAn Anycast-RP can be implemented in a PIM domain by using the following schemes:"
