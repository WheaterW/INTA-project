    "ExtraInfo": "By default, devices on a network with VLANs use VLANIF interfaces to forward packets because these devices cannot generate IPv4 ARP Vlink direct routes. However, direct routes of VLAN users are required in some scenarios. For example, a device needs to apply a unique export policy for each VLAN user to import traffic from remote devices. In this scenario, the device obtains information about the Layer 3 interfaces using ARP and generates relevant routing entries for traffic forwarding."
