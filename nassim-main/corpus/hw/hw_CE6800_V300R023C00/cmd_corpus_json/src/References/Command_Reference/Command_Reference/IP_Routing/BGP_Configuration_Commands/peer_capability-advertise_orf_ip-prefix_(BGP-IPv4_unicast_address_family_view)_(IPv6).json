    "ExtraInfo": "The outbound route filtering (ORF) function uses the import policy of the peer as the export policy of the local end to filter the routes to be sent. The routes that do not comply with the import policy of the peer are not sent to the peer.\nUsers want the carrier to send only the required routes, but the carrier does not want to maintain different export policies for each user. Against this backdrop, the ORF feature can meet the requirements of customers and carriers. ORF supports on-demand route advertisement, which reduces bandwidth consumption and configuration workload."
