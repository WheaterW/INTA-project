    "ExtraInfo": "After a router ID is configured for the BGP-VPN instance IPv6 address family, the router ID of the BGP-VPN instance IPv6 address family can be distinguished from the router ID of BGP, meeting the requirements of specific scenarios.\nFor example, two VPN instances vrf1 and vrf2 are configured on a BGP device. To establish a BGP session between vrf1 and vrf2 through the bound interfaces, you can configure different router IDs for the BGP-VPN instance IPv4 address family. If the router ID is not configured, the BGP peer relationship cannot be established because the router IDs in the BGP-VPN instance IPv4 address family are the same as the BGP router ID.\nThe rules for selecting a router ID for a BGP-VPN instance are as follows:"
