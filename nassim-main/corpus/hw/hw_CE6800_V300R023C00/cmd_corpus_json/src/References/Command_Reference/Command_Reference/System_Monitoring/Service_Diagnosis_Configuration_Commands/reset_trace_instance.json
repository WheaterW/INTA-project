    "ExtraInfo": "After service diagnosis is enabled and a diagnosis object is created on a device, the device creates a diagnosis instance when a user matching the attributes of the diagnosis object gets online. If the device diagnoses services of multiple users, it creates a diagnosis instance for each user, which occupies a large amount of system resources. Therefore, the device needs to delete the diagnosis instance of a user when the user goes online successfully or fails to go online. Additionally, the device provides an aging mechanism for service diagnosis. When the 30-second aging time is reached, the device automatically deletes diagnosis instances to reclaim resources.In addition to the preceding two methods for automatically clearing diagnosis instances, you can run the reset trace instance command to clear all the diagnosis instances."
