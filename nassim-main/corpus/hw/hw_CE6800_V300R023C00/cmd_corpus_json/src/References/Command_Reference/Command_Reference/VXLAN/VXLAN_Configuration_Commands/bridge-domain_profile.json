    "ExtraInfo": "When a TRILL network is replaced with a VXLAN network, the VXLAN configuration workload is heavy. You need to bind VLANs and VNIs to BDs and configure EVPN-related commands in BDs. If there are a large number of BDs, the configuration workload is heavy. To solve this problem, the BD profile function is introduced. You can configure a BD to automatically bind VLANs and VNIs and automatically generate EVPN RD and RT commands in the BD profile. You only need to bind each BD to the profile to complete the preceding configurations."
