    "ExtraInfo": "A large number of BGP peers may exist on a large-scale BGP network. Among these BGP peers, many of them may use the same policies and have the same command configurations. In this situation, you can use peer groups to simplify configurations. Specifically, when configuring multiple peers in the same way, you can create and configure a peer group, and add multiple peers to the peer group. Then, all peers in the peer group will inherit the configurations of the peer group. The peer group enable command enables a peer to be added to a peer group in the BGP VPN instance address family. After being added to a peer group, a peer automatically inherits the configurations of the peer group."
