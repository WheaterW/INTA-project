    "ExtraInfo": "After URPF check is enabled on an interface, the device performs the URPF check on all the packets passing through the interface. To prevent the packets of a certain type from being discarded, you can disable URPF check for these packets. For example, if the device is configured to trust all the packets from a certain server, the device does not check these packets. If you need to disable URPF check, you can run commands in the traffic behavior view and associate the traffic behavior and a traffic classifier with a traffic policy. When the traffic policy is applied globally or applied to an interface, or a VLAN, the device does not perform URPF check on the traffic that matches the traffic classifier rules."
