    "ExtraInfo": "By default, each network product model can customize a threshold to limit the number of IS-IS interfaces that can be configured on a device. Run the isis interface limit disable command to remove the limit on the number of IS-IS interfaces that can be configured on the device. After this command is run, the number of IS-IS interfaces is no longer limited to the device threshold. Run the undo isis interface limit disable command to restore the maximum number of IS-IS interfaces that can be configured on a device. If the number of IS-IS interfaces on the device is greater than or equal to the threshold, no IS-IS interface can be added."
