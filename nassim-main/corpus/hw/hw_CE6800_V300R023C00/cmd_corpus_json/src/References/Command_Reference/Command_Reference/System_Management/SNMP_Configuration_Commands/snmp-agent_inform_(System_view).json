    "ExtraInfo": "After sending an Inform message, an SNMP agent waits for an Inform ACK message sent by the NMS. You can run the snmp-agent inform command to set the timeout, resend-times, and pending parameters for Inform messages.\nThese three parameters affect one another. For example, if the timeout period for waiting for Inform ACK messages prolongs or the number of attempts to retransmit Inform messages increases, but the maximum number of Inform messages to be confirmed is not changed, the number of Inform messages to be confirmed increases, causing the inform buffer to be quickly filled up.\nOnce the inform buffer is filled up, the earliest Inform message in the inform buffer is deleted each time a new Inform message enters the queue. The deleted Inform messages are not retransmitted to the NMS. To prevent this problem, increase the maximum number of Inform messages to be confirmed in the inform buffer.\nYou can configure the snmp-agent inform command to contain the parameter timeout, resend-times, or pending as needed."
