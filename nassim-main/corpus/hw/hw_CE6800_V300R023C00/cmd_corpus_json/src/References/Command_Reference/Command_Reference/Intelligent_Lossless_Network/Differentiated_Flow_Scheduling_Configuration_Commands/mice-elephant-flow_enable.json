    "ExtraInfo": "You can run this command to enable differentiated flow scheduling based on interfaces. For traffic passing through an interface where this function is enabled, the device differentiates elephant and mice flows in queues and preferentially schedules packets in mice flows. In this way, the latency of mice flows is not affected by elephant flows."
