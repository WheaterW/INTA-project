The ipv6 nd anti-attack rate-limit source-ip all maximum command sets the rate limit value for ND packets based on every source IP. The undo ipv6 nd anti-attack rate-limit source-ip all maximum command deletes the rate limit value for ND packets based on every source IP.

    "ExtraInfo": "If a device is attacked, it receives a large number of ND packets within a short period. As a result, the device consumes many CPU resources to learn and respond to ND entries, affecting the processing of other services. To resolve this issue, configure a rate limit for sending ND packets to the CPU based on any source IP address. After the configuration is complete, the device counts the number of ND packets received per period based on any source IP address. If the number of ND packets exceeds the configured limit, the device does not process excess ND packets."
