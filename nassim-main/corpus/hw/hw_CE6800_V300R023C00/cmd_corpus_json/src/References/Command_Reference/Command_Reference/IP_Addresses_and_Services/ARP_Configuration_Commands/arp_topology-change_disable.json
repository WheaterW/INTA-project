    "ExtraInfo": "By default, after a loop-prevention protocol detects a network topology change, it will send a protocol packet to instruct the device to age or delete ARP entries. Then the device will re-learn ARP entries.\nHowever, if the network topology changes frequently or a device has a large number of ARP entries, re-learning of ARP entries causes ARP entry flooding, which consumes network resources and affects other services on the device. To resolve this problem, run the arp topology-change disable command to disable the device from responding to TC packets."
