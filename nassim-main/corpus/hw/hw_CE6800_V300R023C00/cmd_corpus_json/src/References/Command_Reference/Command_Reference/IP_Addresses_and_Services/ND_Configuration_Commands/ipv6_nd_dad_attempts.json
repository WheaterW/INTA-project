    "ExtraInfo": "When you configure IPv6 addresses (including global unicast IPv6 addresses and link-local IPv6 addresses) for interfaces, the DAD function is required. DAD verifies the uniqueness of new unicast IPv6 addresses before the addresses are assigned to interfaces on the local link. It ensures that the IPv6 address to be allocated to an interface is not used by any other interfaces connected with this interface and thus avoids address conflicts."
