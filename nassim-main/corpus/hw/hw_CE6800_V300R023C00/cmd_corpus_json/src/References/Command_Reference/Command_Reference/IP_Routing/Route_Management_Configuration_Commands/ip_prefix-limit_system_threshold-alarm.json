The ip prefix-limit system threshold-alarm command configures thresholds (one alarm threshold and one clear alarm threshold) for the number of IPv4 route prefixes on a device. The undo ip prefix-limit system threshold-alarm command restores the default configuration. By default, the alarm threshold for IPv4 route prefixes is 80%, and the clear alarm threshold for IPv4 route prefixes is 70%.",

    "ExtraInfo": "The number of IPv4 route prefixes that can be added to a routing table is limited. If the number exceeds the limit, new prefixes cannot be added to the routing table, which may interrupt services. To address this problem, configure an alarm threshold for the number of IPv4 route prefixes.\nYou can run the ip prefix-limit system threshold-alarm command to configure the two thresholds based on service requirements."
