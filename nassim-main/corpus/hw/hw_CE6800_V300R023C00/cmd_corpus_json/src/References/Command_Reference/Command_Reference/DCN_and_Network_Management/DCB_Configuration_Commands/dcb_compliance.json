    "ExtraInfo": "Two standards are available for the DCBX protocol: IEEE DCBX and Intel DCBX.\nHuawei switches support both the two standards. By default, an interface sends DCBX TLVs of the IEEE standard version.\nWhen a Huawei switch connects to a non-Huawei device, the two devices must use the same DCBX version. Otherwise, DCBX negotiation fails. You can run the dcb compliance command to change the local DCBX version."
