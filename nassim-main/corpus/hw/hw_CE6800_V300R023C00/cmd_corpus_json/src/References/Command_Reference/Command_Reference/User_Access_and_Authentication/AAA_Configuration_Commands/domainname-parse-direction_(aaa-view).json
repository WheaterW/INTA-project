    "ExtraInfo": "In AAA implementations, users belong to different domains. A network access server (NAS) centrally manages users in a domain. During a user's login, the NAS parses the entered user name. A user is authenticated only when the user has the correct user name and domain name. When configuring an AAA scheme, run the domainname-parse-direction { left-to-right | right-to-left } command to configure the direction in which a domain name is parsed.Assume that the user name is username@dom1@dom2.- If the domain-location command configures the domain name behind the domain name delimiter:- When left-to-right is specified, the user name is username and the domain name is dom1@dom2.- When right-to-left is specified, the user name is username@dom1 and the domain name is dom2.- If the domain-location command configures the domain name before the domain name delimiter:- When left-to-right is specified, the user name is dom1@dom2 and the domain name is username.- When right-to-left is specified, the user name is dom2 and the domain name is username@dom1."
