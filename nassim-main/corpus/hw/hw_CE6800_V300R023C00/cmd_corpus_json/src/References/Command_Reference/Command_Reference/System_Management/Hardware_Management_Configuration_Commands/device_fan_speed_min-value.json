    "ExtraInfo": "The fan speed affects the device temperature. When the device temperature is high, increase the fan speed to lower the device temperature. When the device temperature is low, reduce the fan speed to save energy. By default, the system automatically adjusts the fan speed to keep the device temperature proper. You can run the device fan speed min-value command in the system view to set a minimum fan speed. In this way, the system can automatically adjust the fan speed to a value that is not lower than the minimum fan speed.\nYou can also run the device fan speed percent command to set the fan speed."
