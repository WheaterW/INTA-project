    "ExtraInfo": "A device sets up BGP peer relationships with some servers in a VLAN through a VLANIF interface. If the physical status of the interface connected to a server goes Down, the BGP peer cannot detect the status change in time, and the BGP peer relationship is disconnected only after a period of time (180s by default). During this period, traffic is lost. To prevent this problem, run the peer rely-state interface command to configure the BGP peer to track the physical status of a specified physical interface. The establishment of a BGP peer relationship depends on the physical status of the specified physical interface. If the physical status of the specified physical interface is Up, the BGP peer relationship can be established. If the physical status is Down, the BGP peer relationship is disconnected."
