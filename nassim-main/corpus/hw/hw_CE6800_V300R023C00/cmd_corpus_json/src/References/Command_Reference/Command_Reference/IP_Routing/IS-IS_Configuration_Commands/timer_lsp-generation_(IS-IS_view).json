    "ExtraInfo": "For IS-IS, when the local routing information is changed, some new LSPs (or LSP fragments) need to be generated to advertise the change of routes. If the change occurs frequently, immediate generation of LSPs (or LSP fragments) will consume a large number of resources.\nTo speed up network convergence and prevent the system from being affected, use an intelligent timer to control the LSP generation interval. Using the timer, you can adjust the LSP generation interval based on the route change frequency.\nBefore using the\ntimer lsp-generation command, note the following:"
