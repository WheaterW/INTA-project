For example, a large number of Flush packets are sent after a link switchover is performed in a Smart Link group. If a device is faulty, you can check information about received Flush packets to help locate the fault. If existing Flush packet statistics are of no use, run the reset smart-link flush command to clear the statistics to avoid the impact of excessive Flush packet statistics on the next fault locating."
