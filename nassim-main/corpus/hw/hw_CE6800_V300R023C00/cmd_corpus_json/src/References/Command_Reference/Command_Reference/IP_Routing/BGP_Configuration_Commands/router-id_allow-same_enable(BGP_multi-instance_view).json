    "ExtraInfo": "According to the previous protocol, the router ID must be a valid IPv4 host address. The prerequisite for establishing a BGP peer relationship through negotiation is that the router IDs of the two ends are different. In actual scenarios, however, different carriers may set the same router ID. In this case, the peer relationship cannot be established. To solve this problem, the router IDs of EBGP peers can be different, but the router IDs of IBGP peers must be different. That is, IBGP peer relationships cannot be established between devices with the same router ID, but EBGP peer relationships can be established between devices with the same router ID.\nIn BGP multi-instance, to allow EBGP peer relationships to be established between peers with the same router ID, run the router-id allow-same enable command."
