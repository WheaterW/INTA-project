The igmp snooping proxy router-protocol-pass command configures transparent transmission of IGMP Report, IGMP Leave, Group-Specific Query, and Group-and-Source-Specific Query messages. The undo igmp snooping proxy router-protocol-pass command disables the device from transparently transmitting IGMP Report, IGMP Leave, Group-Specific Query, and Group-and-Source-Specific Query messages. By default, a device enabled with IGMP snooping proxy terminates received Report messages, Leave messages, Group-Specific Query messages, and Group-and-Source-Specific Query messages.",

    "ExtraInfo": "If IGMP snooping proxy is enabled on the upstream and downstream devices, the upstream and downstream devices learn the same multicast forwarding entries. In addition, the upstream and downstream devices continuously send IGMP Query and Report messages to each other, and multicast entries will never be aged out. As a result, multicast protocol messages and data flows are forwarded meaninglessly on the network. After this command is run, the device does not accept IGMP Report messages, IGMP Leave messages, Group-Specific Query messages, or Group-and-Source-Specific Query messages. Instead, the device transparently transmits protocol messages received from a router port to other router ports.\nYou are advised to run this command on a dual-homing network where IGMP snooping proxy is enabled."
