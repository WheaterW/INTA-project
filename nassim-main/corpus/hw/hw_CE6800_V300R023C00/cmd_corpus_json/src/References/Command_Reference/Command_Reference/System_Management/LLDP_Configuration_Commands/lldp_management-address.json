    "ExtraInfo": "The management IP address is carried in the Management Address TLV in an LLDP packet. The management IP address is used by the NMS to identify devices and implement network management. A management IP address uniquely identifies a device, helping the NMS to determine the network topology and management devices. You can run the lldp management-address command to enable LLDP packets to be advertised to neighbors to carry the management IP address of the local device.\nTo specify the IP address of an interface as the LLDP management address, run the lldp management-address bind interface command to bind the LLDP management address to the interface.After the LLDP management address is bound to the interface, the device uses the interface's IP address as the management address, if no management address has been configured using the lldp management-address command."
