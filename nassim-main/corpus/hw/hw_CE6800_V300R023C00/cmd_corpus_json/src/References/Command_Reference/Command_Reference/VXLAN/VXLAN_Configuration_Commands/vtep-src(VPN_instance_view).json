The vtep-src command configures a source VXLAN tunnel endpoint (VTEP) address for a VXLAN tunnel in a VPN instance. The undo vtep-src command restores the default configuration.

    "ExtraInfo": "When configuring a VXLAN tunnel, first configure an IP address for the source VTEP. This IP address serves as the source IP address of VXLAN packets. Because a VXLAN tunnel is established between a source VTEP and a peer VTEP, a different IP address also needs to be configured for the peer VTEP. This IP address serves as the destination IP address in VXLAN packets.\nIn a VXLAN application scenario, to enable two VXLAN tunnels that are based on different physical paths between two nodes to load service data and optimize traffic, run the vxlan tunnel source vtep address command on both ends to specify the source VTEP address for the VXLAN tunnel in a VPN instance."
