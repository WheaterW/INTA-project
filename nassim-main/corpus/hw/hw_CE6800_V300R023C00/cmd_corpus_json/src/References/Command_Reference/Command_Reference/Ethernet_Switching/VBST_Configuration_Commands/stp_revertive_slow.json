    "ExtraInfo": "When a VBST-enabled device interworks with a PVST-enabled third-party device that does not support P/A negotiation, negotiation is asynchronous. As a result, the network convergence time is long. If the remote device is the root bridge and the VBST-enabled device provides the alternate port in addition to the interconnected port, you can enable the delay in revertive switching on the interconnected interface. The delay is calculated as follows: 2 * Forward Delay + 8s After the delay function is enabled, the remote interface first completes spanning tree calculation when the port status changes. Then the local interface performs spanning tree status switching. During status switching, services are not interrupted."
