    "ExtraInfo": "By default, a PIM-SM domain has only one BSR and the entire PIM-SM domain is managed by the BSR. A PIM-SM domain can be divided into multiple BSR administrative domains and a global domain to facilitate network management. This can reduce the workload of a single BSR and provide dedicated services for users in a specific domain by using private group addresses.\nEach BSR administrative domain maintains a BSR that serves the multicast groups on the network segment 239.0.0.0/8. The multicast packets for the groups on this network segment cannot go across the border of the BSR administrative domain. The multicast groups that do not belong to any BSR administrative domain belong to the global domain. The global domain maintains a BSR that serves all the remaining multicast groups, that is, multicast groups beyond 239.0.0.0/8.\nA BSR administrative domain is similar to a VPN in unicast and multicast address 239.0.0.0/8 is equivalent to unicast address 10.0.0.0/8. Other multicast group addresses are common on the public network and cannot conflict with each other. After a PIM-SM domain is divided into different BSR administrative domains, each BSR administrative domain is equivalent to a VPN, and the multicast address in a BSR administrative domain must be 239.0.0.0/8. The same multicast group address can be used in different BSR administration domains."
