    "ExtraInfo": "The number of devices increases with the network expansion, which leads to a large LSDB on each OSPFv3-enabled device on a large-scale network.  Consequently, route flapping frequently occurs and thus a large number of OSPF packets are transmitted on the network, which wastes bandwidth resources. OSPFv3 addresses the preceding problem by logically partitioning an AS into different areas.\nOSPFv3 adds instance-idto identify interfaces. During the configuration, ensure that the instance-idvalues of the two devices that establish a neighbor relationship are the same. Different instance-idvalues identify different OSPFv3 logical interfaces."
