    "ExtraInfo": "To change the priority of Telnet packets sent by a client, you can run this command to change the DSCP value. A larger DSCP value indicates a higher priority.When you run the undo command to restore the default value of the DSCP field, the meanings of the value parameter are as follows:If value is not specified, the DSCP field is restored to the default value.If value is set to 48, the DSCP field is restored to the default value.If value is set to a non-48 value, the value must be the same as that in the configuration command. Otherwise, the undo command will fail to be executed.This command takes effect only for IPv4 packets."
