The fail-percent command sets the failure percent threshold for an NQA test instance of ICMP Ping test type. The undo fail-percent command deletes the failure percent threshold. By default, the failure percent threshold is 100. A test is considered failed only after all probes fail.",

    "ExtraInfo": "A test consists of several probes. On an unreliable network, the probe-count command can be used to set the number of probes for an NQA test instance. The analysis on statistics about probe packets helps you monitor network quality.\nSome or all sent probe packets may be discarded. In this case, you can run the fail-percent command to set the failure percent threshold. When the number of failed probes reaches the specified percent threshold, the test is considered failed.\nFor example, 10 probes are set using the probe-count command, and seven probes fail."
