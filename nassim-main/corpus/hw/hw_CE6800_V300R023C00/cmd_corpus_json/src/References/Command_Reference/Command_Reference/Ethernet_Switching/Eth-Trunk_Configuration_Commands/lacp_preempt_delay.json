    "ExtraInfo": "If a member interface of an Eth-Trunk interface in static Link Aggregation Control Protocol (LACP) mode fails, it goes to the backup state. When the member interface recovers, it switches to the forwarding state. To avoid unstable data transmission on the Eth-Trunk link due to the member interface's alternating between Up and Down, you can run the lacp preempt delay command to configure a preemption delay. In this manner, the member interface switches to the forwarding state only after the preemption delay expires."
