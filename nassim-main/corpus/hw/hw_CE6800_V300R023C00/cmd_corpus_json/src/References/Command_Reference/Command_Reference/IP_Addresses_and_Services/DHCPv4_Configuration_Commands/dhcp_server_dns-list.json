    "ExtraInfo": "This command applies to DHCP servers. If user hosts access hosts on the network through the domain name, user hosts need to send DNS Request messages to the DNS server and resolve the domain name. To enable DNS services on the DHCP client, specify the DNS server address for the interface address pool on the DHCP server. The DHCP server can assign both the specified DHCP server address and an IP address to the client. To configure DNS server addresses for a global address pool, run the dns-list command."
