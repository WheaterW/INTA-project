    "ExtraInfo": "Frames sent from user hosts are untagged and those sent from a remote device may also be untagged. However, a switching device only processes and forwards tagged frames. Therefore, tags need to be added to the untagged frames on the switching device. To implement this function, run the port default vlan command to configure a default VLAN on an interface of the switching device. After this function is enabled, the interface adds the default VLAN ID to received untagged frames.\nAfter a default VLAN is configured on an interface:\nThe interface inserts the default VLAN ID to a received untagged frame if the link type of the interface is access or hybrid.\nWhen the interface receives a tagged frame:\nIf the interface type is access and the VLAN ID in the tag is the same as the default VLAN ID, the access interface forwards the frame.\nIf the VLAN ID in the tag is different from the default VLAN ID, the access interface discards the frame.\nIf the interface type is hybrid and the VLAN ID in the tag is in the permitted VLAN ID list, the hybrid interface forwards the frame.\nIf the VLAN ID is not in the permitted VLAN ID list, the hybrid interface discards the frame.\nWhen the interface sends a tagged frame:\nIf the interface type is access, the access interface removes the VLAN tag and then forwards the frame.\nIf the interface type is hybrid, the hybrid interface removes or keeps the VLAN tag in a frame as required and then forwards the frame."
