    "ExtraInfo": "To improve password security, you are advised to run this command to set the validity period of a local user password. After the validity period expires, the password becomes invalid. If a user uses this password to log in to the device, the device displays a message indicating that the password has expired and asking the user whether to change the password after the user successfully logs in. If the user enters Y, the user needs to enter the old password, new password, and confirm password. The password can only be successfully changed when the old password is correct, the new password and confirm password are the same, and the new password meets the password length and complexity requirements. Then, the user can log in to the device. If the user enters N or fails to change the password, the user cannot log in to the device."
