If a DHCP server and its DHCP relay agent are on different network segments, you can run the gateway command to specify an egress gateway address for the DHCP relay agent. In this way, the DHCP relay agent can communicate with the DHCP server. Run the gateway-list command to configure an egress gateway for the DHCP server."
