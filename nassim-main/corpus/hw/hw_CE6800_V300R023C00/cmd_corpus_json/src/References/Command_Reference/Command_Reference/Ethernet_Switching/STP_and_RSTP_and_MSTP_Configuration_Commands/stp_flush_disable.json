    "ExtraInfo": "On loop-free networks, STP is still configured to prevent potential loops caused by incorrect connections. However, STP will send TC BPDUs to instruct devices to update MAC address entries when the network topology encounters any changes. For example, the local device's interface goes Up from Down. This change does not require MAC address updates. If MAC addresses are updated in a large scale, unknown unicast or broadcast may occur.\nTo resolve this problem, run the stp flush disable command to disable a device or MSTP process from updating MAC address entries when it receives TC BPDUs."
