    "ExtraInfo": "The next-server command is used on DHCP servers. When assigning a client an IP address, a DHCP server can also assign the client an IP address of the server that provides network services for the client. For example, after obtaining IP addresses, clients such as IP phones need parameters such as the startup configuration file to work normally. You can run the next-server command to specify the server address used after a client obtains an IP address. The client then requests the configuration parameters from the specified server after obtaining an IP address."
