    "ExtraInfo": "To lock traffic on the master or slave interface in a Smart Link group, run the smart-link command. The command allows the traffic to be transmitted only along the primary or secondary link. For example, if you want to have the primary link in a Smart Link group inspected during maintenance, run the smart-link force command to lock traffic on the slave interface of the secondary link before the inspection to prevent a service interruption, and run the undo smart-link force command after the inspection. Then, traffic automatically switches back to the primary link if the switchback function is enabled."
