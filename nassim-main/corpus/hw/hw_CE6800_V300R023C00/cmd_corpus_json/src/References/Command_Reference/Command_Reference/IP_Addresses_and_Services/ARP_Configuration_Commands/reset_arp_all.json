    "ExtraInfo": "If an unauthorized user sends a large number of ARP messages to a device, the device learns a large number of ARP entries in a short period of time, causing a buffer overflow. As a result, users may fail to access the network. To resolve the problem, run the reset arp command to delete invalid ARP entries so that new ARP entries can be created to allow authorized user access."
