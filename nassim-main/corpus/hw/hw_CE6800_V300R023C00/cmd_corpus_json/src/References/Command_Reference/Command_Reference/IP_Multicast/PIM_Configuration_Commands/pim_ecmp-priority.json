    "ExtraInfo": "In a PIM FRR scenario where multicast PIM FRR is implemented using unicast route ECMP, the primary and backup inbound interfaces for PIM FRR are selected based on the next-hop IP addresses of unicast routes. The interface with the largest next-hop IP address is selected as the primary inbound interface, and the interface with the second largest next-hop IP address is selected as the backup inbound interface. In this scenario, the selection of the primary and backup inbound interfaces depends on the next-hop IP addresses, which is not flexible. In this case, you can configure the PIM ECMP priority function. After the PIM ECMP priority function is configured, the device selects the primary and backup inbound interfaces based on the PIM ECMP priority. The interface with the highest PIM ECMP priority is selected as the PIM FRR primary inbound interface, and the interface with the second highest PIM ECMP priority is selected as the backup inbound interface.In a common PIM multicast scenario, if PIM entries are generated using ECMP for unicast routes, the upstream interface of a PIM entry is selected based on the next-hop IP address of the unicast route. The interface with the largest next-hop IP address is selected as the upstream interface. In this scenario, the selection of the upstream inbound interface depends on the next-hop IP address, which is not flexible. In this case, you can configure the PIM ECMP priority function. After the PIM ECMP priority function is configured, the device selects the upstream inbound interface based on the PIM ECMP priority. The interface with the highest PIM ECMP priority is selected as the upstream inbound interface."
