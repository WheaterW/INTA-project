    "ExtraInfo": "This command is used when the multicast switching performance on the M-LAG or port-group interface does not meet requirements, the entry switching time is long, and a large number of packets are lost. After this function is configured, the device ignores the Up/Down state of an interface. When the interface goes Down, the device does not delete the Layer 2 multicast entries of the interface. In this way, Layer 2 multicast services can be quickly restored after the interface goes Up."
