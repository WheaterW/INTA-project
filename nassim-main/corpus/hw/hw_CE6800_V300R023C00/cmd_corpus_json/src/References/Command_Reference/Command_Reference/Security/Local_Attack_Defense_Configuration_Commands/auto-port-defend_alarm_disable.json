    "ExtraInfo": "If a port undergoes a DoS attack, the malicious attack packets sent from this port to the CPU occupy bandwidth. As a result, the CPU cannot process the protocol packets sent from other ports, and services are interrupted. In this situation, you can enable the report of port attack defense events. When the rate of protocol packets on a port exceeds the check threshold, the switch reports an event to notify the network administrator, so that the administrator can promptly take measures to protect the switch."
