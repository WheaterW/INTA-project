    "ExtraInfo": "When a large-scale OSPF network is deployed, the route search speed may be slowed down because the size of the OSPF routing table is too large. To solve this problem, you can configure route summarization to reduce the size of the routing table and simplify management.\nRoute summarization allows multiple routes with the same IP prefix to be summarized into one route. If a link within the summary IP address range frequently alternates between Up and Down, the change is not advertised to the devices beyond the summary IP address range. This prevents route flapping on the network and improves network stability.\nIf the imported routes have the same prefix, you can run the asbr-summary command to summarize these routes and advertise them as one summary route. Route summarization reduces the size of a routing table and improves device performance."
