    "ExtraInfo": "To implement data flow control and limit information that downstream receivers can obtain, run the source-policy command to configure a policy using which the Router filters received multicast data packets based on source addresses or based on source and group addresses. The Router forwards a received multicast data packet only if it is permitted by an ACL rule defined in the filter policy, thus improving system security.\nThe source-policy command configuration also applies to multicast data packets encapsulated in Register messages."
