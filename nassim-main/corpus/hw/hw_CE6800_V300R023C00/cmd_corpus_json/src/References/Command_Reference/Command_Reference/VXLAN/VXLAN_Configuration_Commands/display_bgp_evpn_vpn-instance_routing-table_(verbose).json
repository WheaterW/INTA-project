The value is in the format of E:M:H-H-H:L:X.X.X.X or E:M:H-H-H:L: [X:X::X:X], where:\nE indicates the ID of the VLAN to which the MAC address belongs.M is fixed at 48, indicating the length of the MAC address.H-H-H indicates the MAC address. The value is a 12-digit hexadecimal number, in the format of H-H-H. Each H contains 1 to 4 digits, such as 00e0 or fc01. If an H contains fewer than 4 digits, the left-most digits are padded with 0s. For example, e0 is displayed as 00e0.L is fixed at 0, indicating the mask length of the IP address corresponding to the MAC address.X.X.X.X indicates the IP address corresponding to the MAC address.
