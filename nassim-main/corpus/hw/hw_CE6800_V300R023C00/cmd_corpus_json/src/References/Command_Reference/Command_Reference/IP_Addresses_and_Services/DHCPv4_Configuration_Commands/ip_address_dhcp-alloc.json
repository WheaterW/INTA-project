    "ExtraInfo": "To enable an interface of the device to obtain IP addresses using DHCP, enable the DHCP client function on the interface. A BOOTP client applies for an IP address from the server using DHCP. The DHCP client has two functions:- Sends DHCP Request messages to the server.- Processes DHCP Reply messages from the server.To obtain an IP address, the DHCP client sends a DHCP Request message to the server. After the server receives the DHCP Request message, it sends a DHCP response message to the DHCP client. The DHCP client obtains the assigned IP address from the response message."
