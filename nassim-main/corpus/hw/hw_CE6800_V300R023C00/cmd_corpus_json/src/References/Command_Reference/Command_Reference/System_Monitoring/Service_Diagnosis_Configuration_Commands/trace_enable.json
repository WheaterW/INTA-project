Service diagnosis allows maintenance personnel to customize attributes and create diagnosis objects to diagnose information about services of specified users. To enable service diagnosis, run the trace enable command.\nService diagnosis information can be displayed in two methods:\nThe trace enable brief command configures the device to output brief service diagnosis information.\nThe trace enable command configures the device to output detailed service diagnosis information."
