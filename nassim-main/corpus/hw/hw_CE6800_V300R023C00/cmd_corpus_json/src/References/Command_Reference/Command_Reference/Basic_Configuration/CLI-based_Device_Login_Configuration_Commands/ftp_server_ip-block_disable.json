Client IPv4 and IPv6 addresses being locked fail the authentication and are displayed in the display ftp server ip-block list command output.If an FTP server is disabled from locking client IP addresses, the display ftp server ip-block list command does not display any client IP address that is locked because of authentication failures.IP addresses being locked are unlocked immediately after the FTP server is disabled from locking client IP addresses."
