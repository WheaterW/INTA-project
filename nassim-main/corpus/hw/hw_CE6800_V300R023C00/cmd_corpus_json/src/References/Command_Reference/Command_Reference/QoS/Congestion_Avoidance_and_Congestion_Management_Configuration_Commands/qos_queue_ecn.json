    "ExtraInfo": "After the downstream and upstream devices support ECN, the downstream device identifies and marks the network congestion based on the ECN field in the packets. The downstream device notifies the upstream device of the detected network congestion. Upon receiving the notification, the upstream device lowers the rate of sending packets to avoid worsening congestion."
