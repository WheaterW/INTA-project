    "ExtraInfo": "In VPN networking, users in a VPN instance can communicate with users in another VPN instance only if the two VPN instances have matching VPN targets, but cannot communicate with public network users. To enable a VPN to communicate with the public network, you have to ensure that the VPN and public network users can obtain routes to each other. To import public network routes to a VPN instance, run the import-rib public command.\nIn VPN networking, users of a VPN instance can communicate with users of another VPN instance only if the two VPN instances have matching VPN targets. To enable users in different VPN instances to communicate with each other, ensure that users in different VPN instances can obtain routes from each other. To import routes from another VPN instance to a specified VPN instance, run the import-rib vpn-instance command.\nIn an intelligent traffic control scenario, traffic of different users are distributed to different VPNs. To enable tenant traffic to flow to the public network, run the import-rib protocol isis command to import public network routes to the VPN instance.\nWhen VLAN tag termination sub-interfaces are used to import routes between VPN and public network instances, traffic forwarding depends on direct routes (Vlink direct routes) generated based on user entries. However, the direct routes imported between VPN and public network instances do not contain Vlink direct routes. As a result, traffic fails to be forwarded. To solve this problem, route import between VPN and public network instances newly supports import of Vlink direct routes."
