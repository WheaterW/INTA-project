In addition, network attackers often use ICMP error packets to spy on the internal structure of the network.\nTo improve network performance and security, run the icmp receive disable command to disable the system from receiving ICMP packets of a specified type.\nIf you want to restore the default configuration and the display this command output does not contain the icmp receive or undo icmp receive command configuration, run the clear icmp receive command."
