A user-defined format can be:\nFormat defined by keywords: The Remote-ID is defined based on the keywords supported by the user-defined format. For example, if the name of the device to which the users are connected and the outer VLAN to which the users belong need to be recorded, the user-defined format can be %sysname %svlan. If the device name is HUAWEI and the S-VLAN is 100, the user location information recorded by the Remote-ID is HUAWEI 100. For description of the keywords supported by the user-defined format, see the usage guide.Format defined by common character strings: The Remote-ID is directly defined as a character string. For example, if all users on an interface are located in the office building named N8, the Remote-ID can be directly defined as N8.Mixed format: The Remote-ID is defined by both the keywords and common character strings. For example, the Remote-ID can be defined as %sysname N8.\nThe value is a string of 1 to 247 case-sensitive characters, spaces supported."

When receiving a request packet from a DHCPv6 client and forwarding the packet to the DHCPv6 server, the device can insert the Remote-ID option into the packet to identify the location of the DHCPv6 client. The location information is used by the DHCPv6 server to assign IPv6 addresses and network parameters. You can run the dhcpv6 remote-id format command to configure the format of the Remote-ID inserted into DHCPv6 packets.\nThe keywords supported by the user-defined option format and their meanings are as follows:"
