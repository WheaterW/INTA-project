    "ExtraInfo": "Generally, hosts use a default gateway to communicate with external networks. If the gateway fails, communication between the hosts and external networks is interrupted. VRRP is a fault-tolerant protocol that allows logical devices to work separately from physical devices and implements route selection among multiple egress gateways."
