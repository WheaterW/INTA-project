    "ExtraInfo": "In an M-LAG dual-homing access scenario where a maintenance mode upgrade is performed, you can run the lacp force-down command on the local device, so that the member interfaces of the local static/dynamic Eth-Trunk interfaces that are added to an M-LAG immediately send LACP Dying Gasp packets to the peer device. After receiving the packets, the peer device sets the member interfaces of Eth-Trunk interfaces to down, directing the server to switch upstream traffic to the standby link. After the upgrade is complete, you can run the undo lacp force-down command to switch the upstream traffic back to the original link."
