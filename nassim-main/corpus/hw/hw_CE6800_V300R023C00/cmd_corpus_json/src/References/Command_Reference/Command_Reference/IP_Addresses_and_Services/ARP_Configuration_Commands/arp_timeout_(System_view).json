    "ExtraInfo": "To ensure communication reliability, you need to update ARP entries when they are invalid. A dynamic ARP entry has a life cycle. If a dynamic ARP entry is not updated before its life cycle ends, this dynamic ARP entry will be deleted from the ARP table. The life cycle is called aging time. If the entry is updated before its life cycle expires, the aging time of the entry is recalculated. You can run the arp timeout command to adjust aging time for ARP entries to ensure their updating."
