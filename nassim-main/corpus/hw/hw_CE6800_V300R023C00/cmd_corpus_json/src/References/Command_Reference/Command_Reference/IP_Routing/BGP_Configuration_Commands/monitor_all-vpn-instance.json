    "ExtraInfo": "BMP is used to monitor BGP running status of devices in real time, such as the establishment and termination status of BGP peer relationships and route update status. To allow the BGP running status of BGP peers in all VPN instance address families to be monitored, run the monitor all-vpn-instance command. After a TCP connection is established between the device and the monitoring server, the device reports BGP running status to the monitoring server, improving network monitoring efficiency."
