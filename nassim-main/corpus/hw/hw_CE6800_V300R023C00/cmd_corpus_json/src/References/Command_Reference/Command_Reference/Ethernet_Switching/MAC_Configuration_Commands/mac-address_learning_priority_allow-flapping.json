    "ExtraInfo": "For a device whose uplink interface connects to a server and downlink interface connects to user terminals, you can disable MAC address flapping on interfaces with the same MAC address learning priority to prevent unauthorized users from intruding the device by forging the server's MAC address. This mechanism prevents the interfaces from learning the same MAC address, and unauthorized users from interfering communication between this device and other devices by using forged MAC addresses.\nBoth the mac-address learning priority and the undo mac-address learning priority allow-flapping commands helps improve network security. The differences are as follows:"
