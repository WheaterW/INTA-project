    "ExtraInfo": "ARP packets are encapsulated into data link frames and are called ARP frames. The length of an ARP frame is 28 bytes. An Ethernet data frame (which may be referred to as a payload, payload) has at least 46 bytes, and therefore, a padding byte (PAD) needs to be padded behind an ARP frame to meet a length requirement of the Ethernet data frame.\nWhen different devices are interconnected, the payload lengths of ARP packets to be sent are different on these devices. As a result, ARP negotiation fails and in turn ARP entries cannot be learned. To prevent this issue, you can configure the same payload length for ARP packets to be sent on the interconnected devices."
