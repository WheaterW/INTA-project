The holdtime timer is reset each time a message is received from the MSDP peer and deleted when the relationship is torn down. The entry is deleted if no message is received from the peer before the holdtime timer expires.\nTo set the holdtime for an MSDP peer entry, run the peer hold-time-interval command."
