    "ExtraInfo": "The dhcpv6-server command is used on DHCPv6 relay agents. To ensure that the DHCPv6 relay agent can send DHCPv6 packets to multiple DHCPv6 servers, you can configure multiple DHCPv6 servers in a DHCPv6 server group. Multiple DHCPv6 servers can allocate IPv6 addresses and other network configuration information to DHCPv6 clients through the DHCPv6 relay agent.\nA DHCPv6 client and a DHCPv6 server can have multiple DHCPv6 relay agents connected in between. A device functions as a DHCPv6 relay agent. If the device is connected to a DHCPv6 server, you need to specify the IPv6 address for the DHCPv6 server. If the device is connected to a next-hop relay agent, you need to specify the IPv6 address for the next-hop relay agent and specify the IPv6 address of the remote DHCPv6 server or the next-hop relay agent on the next-hop relay agent."
