    "ExtraInfo": "To prevent SA messages from being circularly forwarded between MSDP peers, MSDP performs the RPF check on the received SA message. MSDP strictly controls the incoming SA messages. The SA message that does not comply with the RPF rules are discarded.\nTo protect the SA messages transmitted between MSDP peers from being discarded because of RPF rules and reduce redundant traffic, you can specify MSDP peers as static RPF peers. The SA messages received from a static RPF peer need not be checked according to RPF rules."
