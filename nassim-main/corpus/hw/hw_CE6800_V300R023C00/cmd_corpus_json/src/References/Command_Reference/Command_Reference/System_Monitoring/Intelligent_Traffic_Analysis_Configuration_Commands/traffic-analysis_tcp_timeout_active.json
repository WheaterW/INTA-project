The traffic-analysis tcp timeout active command configures the active aging period of a TCP flow in intelligent traffic analysis. The undo traffic-analysis tcp timeout active command restores the default configuration. By default, the active aging period of a TCP flow in intelligent traffic analysis is 10 seconds.

    "ExtraInfo": "Network traffic may burst intermittently and a large number of flows are generated in a short period of time. However, the memory capacity of the TAP is limited. Earlier flows in the memory need to be exported to release memory space for new flows. The process of exporting old flows is called aging. Because the storage space of the TAP is also limited, all analyzed flows must be aged out and exported to the TDA for further processing.\nWhen the active time (from the flow creation time to the current time) of a TCP flow in intelligent traffic analysis exceeds the configured active aging period, the flow is exported to the specified destination."
