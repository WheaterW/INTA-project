    "ExtraInfo": "After the igmp snooping report-suppress command is enabled, the device is set to the host mode. When sending Report or Leave messages to the upstream multicast device for the first time, the device sends a robustness variable number of Report or Leave message copies. Subsequently, when periodically responding to IGMP Query messages from the upstream multicast device, the device sends only one IGMP Report message to the upstream multicast device, regardless of the number of ports in the corresponding multicast group. This reduces traffic on the network side. The default robustness variable is 2. You can run the igmp snooping robust command to change the robustness variable."
