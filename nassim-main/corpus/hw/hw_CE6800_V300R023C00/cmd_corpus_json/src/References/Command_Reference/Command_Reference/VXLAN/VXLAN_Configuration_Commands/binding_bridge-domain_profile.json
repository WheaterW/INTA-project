    "ExtraInfo": "When replacing a TRILL network with a VXLAN network, you need to bind VLANs and VNIs to BDs and configure EVPN-related commands in BDs. If there are a large number of BDs, the configuration workload is heavy. To address this issue, a BD profile is introduced to automatically bind VLANs and VNIs to BDs and automatically generate RDs and RTs for EVPN instances. The preceding configurations can be automatically generated for a BD after the BD is bound to the BD profile."
