The m-lag forward layer-2 overlay enhanced enable command enables enhanced M-LAG Layer 2 forwarding in an overlay scenario. The undo m-lag forward layer-2 overlay enhanced enable command disables enhanced M-LAG Layer 2 forwarding in an overlay scenario. By default, enhanced M-LAG Layer 2 forwarding is disabled in an overlay scenario. This command is supported only on the CE6863H, CE6863H-K, CE6881H and CE6881H-K.",

    "ExtraInfo": "To speed up convergence when an M-LAG member interface fails in an overlay scenario, you can enable enhanced M-LAG Layer 2 forwarding. Backup FRR resources are requested for all MAC address entries whose outbound interfaces are M-LAG member interfaces. The outbound interfaces can be changed to peer-link interfaces to establish active and standby paths for traffic forwarding. Once an M-LAG member interface fault is detected, traffic is quickly switched to a peer-link interface, improving the switching performance in fault scenarios."
