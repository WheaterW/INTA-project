    "ExtraInfo": "This command applies to DHCP servers. When a DHCP client uses NetBIOS for communication, its host name needs to be mapped to an IP address, and the NetBIOS node type needs to be specified for it using the netbios-type command. When a DHCP server assigns an IP address to clients, it also sends the specified NetBIOS node type to clients."
