    "ExtraInfo": "This command applies to DHCP relay agents. When multiple DHCP server addresses are configured on a DHCP relay agent, the DHCP relay agent forwards DHCP Discover messages to all servers by default. As a result, DHCP servers need to process a large number of messages, leading to heavy loads of servers. To solve this problem, configure the ip relay address cycle command. After this command is configured, the DHCP relay agent forwards a received DHCP Discover message to one DHCP server at a time, and forwards the DHCP Discover message to a different DHCP server each time it receives the message. Multiple DHCP servers then can allocate the same number of IP addresses, implementing load balancing among DHCP servers."
