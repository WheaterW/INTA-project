    "ExtraInfo": "In an M-LAG dual-homing access maintenance scenario, you can run the advertise bgp ipv4-family unicast lowest-priority enable command to enable BGP on the device to forcibly set the priorities of BGP routes to be advertised to the lowest (changing the MED to the maximum value and the Local_Pref to the minimum value). This configuration ensures that the other devices on the network are instructed not to use this device to forward data and that service traffic can be switched to the other M-LAG member device."
