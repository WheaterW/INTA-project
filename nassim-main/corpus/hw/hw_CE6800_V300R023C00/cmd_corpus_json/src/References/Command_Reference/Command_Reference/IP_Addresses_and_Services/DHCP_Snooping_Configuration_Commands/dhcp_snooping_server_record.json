    "ExtraInfo": "If bogus DHCP servers exist on the network, they send incorrect information to DHCP clients, such as the incorrect gateway address, incorrect DNS server, and incorrect IP address. As a result, DHCP clients cannot access the network or access incorrect networks.\nAfter DHCP server detection is enabled, a DHCP snooping device checks and stores all information about DHCP servers in the DHCP Reply messages, such as DHCP server address and DHCP client port number, in logs. Based on the logs, the network administrator checks for bogus DHCP servers on the network to maintain the network.\nWhen the CHADDR field in the DHCP Request message received by the DHCP snooping device is the same as the MAC address of a DHCP server connected to the trusted interface, the DHCP snooping device discards the message."
