    "ExtraInfo": "When a traffic policy is applied to a VLAN, VLANIF interface, or Eth-Trunk interface, the traffic policy is delivered to all chips of the device. You can run the traffic-policy chip-based-mode command to enable accurate delivery of a traffic policy applied to a VLAN, VLANIF interface, or Eth-Trunk interface. If some chips do not have the corresponding VLAN, VLANIF interface, or member interface of the Eth-Trunk interface, the traffic policy is not delivered to the chips."
