The arp detect mode unicast command configures an interface to send Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) aging probe messages in unicast mode. The undo arp detect mode unicast command restores the default configuration. By default, an interface sends the last ARP aging probe message in broadcast mode and the rest ARP aging probe messages in unicast mode.",

    "ExtraInfo": "Before aging ARP entries, an interface sends ARP aging probe messages at a specified aging probe interval. If responses are received, the device updates ARP entries on the interface. If no response is received for some ARP entries within a specified interval, the device ages these ARP entries. An aging probe message can be unicast or broadcast. To configure an interface to send aging probe messages in unicast mode, run the command.\nWhen a non-Huawei device is connected to a Huawei device, the non-Huawei device receives an ARP aging probe message whose destination MAC address is a broadcast address. If the ARP entry contains the mapping between the IP address and MAC address of the Huawei device, the non-Huawei device discards the ARP aging probe message. The Huawei device deletes the corresponding ARP entry because it does not receive a response to the ARP probe message. As a result, traffic from the network side cannot be forwarded. To solve this problem, configure the Huawei device to send ARP aging probe messages in unicast mode, and configure the non-Huawei device to respond to the unicast ARP aging probe messages."
