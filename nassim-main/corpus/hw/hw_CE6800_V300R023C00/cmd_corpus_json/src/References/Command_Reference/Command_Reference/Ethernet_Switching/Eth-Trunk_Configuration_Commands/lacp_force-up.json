    "ExtraInfo": "In a scenario where a device directly connects to a server through an interface that has been added as a member of an Eth-Trunk interface in static LACP mode, if the server restarts or goes online and the Eth-Trunk member interface does not receive any LACPDU within the specified timeout period, the interface goes down. To enable the interface to continue to forward service traffic, run the lacp force-up command to forcibly set the interface state to force-up. To prevent the force-up function from causing packet loss when server and device interfaces are not correctly connected or the interface is falsely removed from the Eth-Trunk interface, run the lacp force-up extension command to enable the force-up extension function on the interface. After the extension function is enabled, the force-up function can take effect only once. However, if the interface state changes from down to up in the future, the function can take effect again."
