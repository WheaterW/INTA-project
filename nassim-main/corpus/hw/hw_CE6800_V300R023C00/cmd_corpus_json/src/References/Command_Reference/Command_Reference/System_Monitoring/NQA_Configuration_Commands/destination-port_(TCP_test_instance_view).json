    "ExtraInfo": "NQA detects service features by creating test instances. In NQA, two test ends are called an NQA client and an NQA server. An NQA test is initiated by the NQA client. After test instances are configured through commands on the client, NQA places different types of test instances into various test queues. After the test starts, a response packet is returned. Carriers can then know the operating status about protocols by analyzing the received response packet.\nFor a test instance, the port for accessing the server is specified through the destination port number configured with the destination-port command on the client.\nFor example, if you need to detect whether the TCP service runs normally on the peer device through a TCP test instance, perform the following configurations:\nOn the server: Configure the TCP server used for NQA tests, including the client IP addresses that are supported and the TCP port number opened to the client.\nOn the client:\n1.Create an NQA test instance and configure its type as TCP.\n2.Configure the IP address of the server as the destination IP address and configure the opened TCP port number on the server as the destination port number.\n3.Start the test instance."
