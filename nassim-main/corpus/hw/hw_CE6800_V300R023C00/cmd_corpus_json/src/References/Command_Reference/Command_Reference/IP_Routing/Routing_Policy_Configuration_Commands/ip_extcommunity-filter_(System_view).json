    "ExtraInfo": "A VPN-Target extended community filter can be used as a matching condition of a route-policy using a command, such as the if-match extcommunity-filter zz command.\nThe relationship between the rules of the VPN-Target extended community filter is \"OR\", which is different from that of an RD filter. This is because each route has only one RD but can have multiple communities.\nFor example, a VPN-Target extended community filter can be set in either of the following formats, with the same filtering result:\nFormat 1:\nip extcommunity-filter 1 permit rt 100:1 rt 200:1 rt 300:1\nThe filter has one rule, which consists of three VPN-Targets: 100:1, 200:1, and 300:1. The relationship between them is \"OR.\"\nFormat 2:\nip extcommunity-filter 1 permit rt 100:1\nip extcommunity-filter 1 permit rt 200:1 rt 300:1\nThe filter has two rules. Rule 1 consists of VPN-Target 100:1, and rule 2 consists of VPN-Targets 200:1 and 300:1. The relationship between the two rules is \"OR.\"\nIn format 2, the VPN-Target extended community defined in each rule must be a sub-set of route VPN-Target extended communities so that the rule can be matched.\nThe undo ip extcommunity-filter command deletes a specified VPN-Target extended community filter.\nThe display ip extcommunity-filter command displays detailed configurations of the VPN-Target extended community filter."
