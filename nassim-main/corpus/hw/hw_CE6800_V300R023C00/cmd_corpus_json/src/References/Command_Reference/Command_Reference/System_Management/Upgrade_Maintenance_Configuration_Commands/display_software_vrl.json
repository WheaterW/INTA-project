    "ExtraInfo": "Software of an earlier version usually has more vulnerabilities. Attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities to penetrate more systems. Preventing the system from rolling back to an earlier version without authentication or authorization can significantly reduce such risks. You can use the Version Revocation List (VRL) technology to prevent the system from rolling back to a vulnerable version. You can run the display software vrl command to view the VRL version."
