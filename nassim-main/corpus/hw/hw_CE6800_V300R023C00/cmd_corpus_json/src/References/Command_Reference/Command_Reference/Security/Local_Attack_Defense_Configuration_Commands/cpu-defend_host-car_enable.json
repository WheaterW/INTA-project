    "ExtraInfo": "User-side hosts are prone to virus attacks, and infected hosts can send a large number of protocol packets to devices, overloading device CPUs and deteriorating their performance, which ultimately impacting services. You can configure user-level rate limiting to address this issue. User-level rate limiting identifies users based on MAC addresses and limits the rate of specified packets. By default, the threshold for each user MAC address is 10 pps.\nCompared to CPCAR based on boards, rate limiting based on user MAC addresses can be accurate to each user and has little impact on normal users."
