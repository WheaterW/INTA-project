    "ExtraInfo": "On a network deployed with high-speed data services, if a link fault occurs, it takes a long time for RIP to detect the link fault. As a result, a large amount of data is lost. Therefore, BFD needs to be deployed on the network to speed up RIP link detection.\nYou can run the rip bfd static binding command to enable BFD on a specified link to rapidly detect link faults. In addition, there are a large number of devices that do not support BFD. Therefore, you can run this command to implement unaffiliated BFD detection independently of other devices."
