    "FuncDef": "The clock map unk command maps an SSM level to the clock source with an SSM level of unk. The clock map unk command maps an SSM level to the clock source with an SSM level of unk. By default, dnu is mapped to the clock source with an SSM level of unk. If SSM levels are configured to participate in clock source selection, the clock source with an SSM level of unk cannot participate in clock source selection. This command is supported only on the CE6863H, CE6863H-K, CE6860-SAN, CE6866K, CE6866, CE6860-HAM, CE6855-48XS8CQ, CE6885-SAN, CE8850-SAN, CE8855, CE8851-32CQ4BQ, CE8851K, CE8851-32CQ8DQ-P, CE8850-HAM, CE6881H-48S6CQ, CE6881H-48S6CQ-K, CE6885, CE6885-T, CE6885-LL (standard forwarding mode) and CE6863E-48S8CQ.",
