    "ExtraInfo": "In a segment VXLAN scenario for DCI, to allow VMs in different DCs to communicate with each other, run the peer advertise route-reoriginated command on a DC edge device connecting to a carrier backbone network. The edge device then re-encapsulates the EVPN routes received from one DC and sends them to BGP EVPN peers in another DC.\nAfter receiving an EVPN route from a DC, an edge leaf node re-encapsulates the EVPN route as follows: Modifies the next hop address of the EVPN route as its own VTEP address, replaces the source MAC address (functioning as the gateway MAC address) of the host route contained in the EVPN route with its own MAC address, and replaces the L3VNI in the EVPN route with the L3VNI in the edge leaf's L3VPN instance."
