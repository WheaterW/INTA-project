    "ExtraInfo": "By periodically exchanging LLDP packets with neighbors, a device can notify neighbors of its own status to ensure the accuracy and timely discovery of network topology and communication stability.\nTo configure a global interval for a device to send LLDP packets, run the lldp transmit interval command. This command helps adjust the frequency of network topology discovery."
