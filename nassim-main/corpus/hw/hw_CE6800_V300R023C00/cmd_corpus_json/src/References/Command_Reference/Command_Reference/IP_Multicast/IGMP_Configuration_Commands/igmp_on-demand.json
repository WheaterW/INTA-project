    "ExtraInfo": "igmp on-demand enables a host to become a static data receiver of a multicast group on a multicast device's interface connected to an access device, thus reducing packet exchanges and workloads of the multicast and access devices. To enable this function, run the igmp on-demand command, so that entries of dynamically joined IGMP groups will not age on a specified interface.\nThis command applies only to IGMPv2 and IGMPv3 interfaces connected to access devices, not to user hosts."
