    "ExtraInfo": "OSPF defines that the interval at which LSAs are received is 1s, which prevents network connections or frequent route flapping from consuming excessive network bandwidth or device resources.\nOn a stable network that requires fast route convergence, you can change the interval at which LSAs are received to 0s. In this manner, the device can fast respond to topology or route changes, which speeds up route convergence.\nOn an unstable network, routes are calculated frequently, which consumes a great number of CPU resources. In addition, LSPs that describe the unstable topology are generated and transmitted on the unstable network. Frequently processing such LSAs affects the rapid and stable operation of the entire network. You can configure an intelligent timer so that the device can dynamically adjust the interval according to the user configuration and the frequency of triggering events (such as route calculation) to speed up network convergence.\nIf there is no special network requirement, default values are recommended."
