    "ExtraInfo": "In a scenario where segment VXLAN is used to implement Layer 2 interworking between DCs, a VXLAN tunnel is established in BGP EVPN mode between the DCs. To prevent forwarding BUM traffic from causing loops, run the peer split-group command on the transit leaf nodes (edge devices interconnecting the DCs) to configure an SHG to which the BGP EVPN peers (transit leaf nodes) belong. After the configuration is complete, devices within a DC belong to the default SHG, and transit leaf nodes between DCs belong to the specified SHG. In this manner, when a transit leaf node receives BUM traffic, it does not forward traffic to a device belonging to the same SHG, therefore preventing loops."
