    "ExtraInfo": "When telemetry-based static subscription is configured to collect sampled data and multiple sampling paths are configured, the device may need to frequently send data to the server. In this case, you can run the pack enable command to enable the device to combine multiple sampled data packets and send them to the server. This reduces the number of data sending times and improves the server performance."
