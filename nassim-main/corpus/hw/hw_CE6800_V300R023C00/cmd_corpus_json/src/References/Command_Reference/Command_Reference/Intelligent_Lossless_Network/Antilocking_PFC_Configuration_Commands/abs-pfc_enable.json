    "ExtraInfo": "Antilocking PFC is a type of PFC technology that enables a device to periodically scan the buffer usage of priority queues on an interface, and then send PFC frames to the upstream device to control the period during which the upstream device stops sending traffic. This allows the device to constantly adjust when traffic is being sent or paused. After specifying a priority queue in an antilocking PFC profile, you need to run this command to enable antilocking PFC on an interface."
