This greatly affects the device and network, and may cause a specific device to collapse and the network to be unavailable.\nFlapping control applies to reduce the adverse impact on the network stability caused by interface status changes.\nBy default, the penalty value for interface suppression increases by 400 each time the interface goes Down, this value is 1000 times the actual value of the device.\nFor concepts and principles of interface flapping control, see interface flapping control.\ndecay-ok and decay-ng can be configured separately:"
