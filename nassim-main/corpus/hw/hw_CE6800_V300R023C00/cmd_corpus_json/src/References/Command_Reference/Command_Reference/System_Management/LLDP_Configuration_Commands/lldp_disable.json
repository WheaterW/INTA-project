    "ExtraInfo": "If LLDP is enabled on a device, the device can use specified interfaces to exchange LLDP packets with neighbors, learning neighbor status information while sending local status information to neighbors. By collecting status information stored on each network device, the NMS can discover the overall network topology.\nNote that LLDP takes effect on a device only after LLDP is enabled globally and on specified interfaces. If LLDP is disabled on an interface, the device cannot use this interface to exchange LLDP packets with neighbors. The lldp enable command allows you to enable LLDP on a specific interface."
