    "ExtraInfo": "You can run this command to set the neighbor timeout period carried in PIM Hello packets to be sent by a router. If the receive end does not receive any Hello packet from the local device within the timeout period, the receive end considers that the local neighbor is aged. If routers need to quickly detect PIM neighbor changes, set this parameter to a smaller value, but the value must be greater than the configured interval for sending Hello messages. The timer hello and pim ipv6 timer hello commands can be used to set the interval at which a PIM neighbor sends Hello messages.\nSet a proper value for the interval parameter in the pim hello-option holdtime command based on the configuration of the timer hello or pim ipv6 timer hello command run on PIM neighbors."
