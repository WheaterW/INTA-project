    "ExtraInfo": "If a link topology changes, devices will receive a link change event. Normally, these devices do not send IGMP general query messages. The link topology change, however, causes a ring network protocol to recalculate paths. As a result, multicast data cannot be switched to the new path in time. The igmp snooping send-query enable command can be used to address this problem. This command enables a device to resend IGMP general Query messages after receiving a link change, update port information, and rapidly switch multicast data to the new forwarding path. This ensures uninterrupted multicast services. Updating port information involves the following operations:"
