If a device receives no Keepalive message or any other type of message from its peer within the specified hold time, the device considers the BGP connection interrupted and closes the BGP connection.\nIn addition, if the device fails to send BGP Update and Keepalive messages within twice the hold time, an alarm is reported. If the alarm is not cleared within the specified send hold time, the BGP connection is reset."
