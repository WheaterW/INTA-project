    "ExtraInfo": "The Interface-ID option records user access information such as the inbound interface of the DHCPv6 Request packets sent from the clients to the device. The user access information can be used by the DHCPv6 server to assign IPv6 addresses and network parameters. When the device functions as a DHCPv6 relay agent or lightweight DHCPv6 relay agent (LDRA), and the device receives the Request packets sent from the DHCPv6 clients and forwards the packets to the DHCPv6 server, the device adds the Interface-ID option in the packets to identify location information of the DHCPv6 clients by default. If the DHCPv6 server interconnected to the device does not support the Interface-ID option, you can run the undo dhcpv6 interface-id insert enable command to configure the device not to add the Interface-ID option in DHCPv6 packets to flexibly control option information obtained by the DHCPv6 server."
