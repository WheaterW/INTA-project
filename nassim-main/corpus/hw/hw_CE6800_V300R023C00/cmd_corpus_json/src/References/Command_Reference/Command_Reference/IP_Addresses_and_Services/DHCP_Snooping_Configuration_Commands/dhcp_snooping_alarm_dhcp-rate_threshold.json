An alarm is generated when the number of discarded DHCP messages reaches the threshold.\nThe configuration in the system view is used to check all packets on the device, the configuration in the interface view is used only for the interface, and the configuration in the VLAN view is used only for the VLAN. The configurations in the system view, interface view, and VLAN view are independent of each other."
