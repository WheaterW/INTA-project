    "ExtraInfo": "After the igmp snooping report-suppress command is run, the device is configured to work in host mode. Assume that the robustness variable is N, the device sends N Report messages and N Leave messages to an upstream router for the first time. When the device periodically responds to IGMP Query messages sent by the upstream router, the device needs to send only one IGMP Report message to the upstream router to reduce traffic on the network side, regardless of the number of interfaces in the multicast group. The default robustness variable is 2. You can run the igmp snooping robust command to change a robustness variable."
