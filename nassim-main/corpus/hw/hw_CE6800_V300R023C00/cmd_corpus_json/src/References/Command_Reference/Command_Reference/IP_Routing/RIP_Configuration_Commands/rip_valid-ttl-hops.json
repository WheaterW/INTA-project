    "ExtraInfo": "If an attacker simulates RIP packets and keeps sending them to a device, the device directly sends the packets to the RIP module on the control plane without checking their validity. As a result, the control plane of the device is busy processing these packets and the CPU usage is high. GTSM protects a device against such attacks by checking whether the TTL value in an IP packet header is within a pre-defined range to improve system security.\nThe rip valid-ttl-hops command is used to enable RIP GTSM."
