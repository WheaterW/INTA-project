    "ExtraInfo": "If the graceful-restart command is run in the BGP view to enable GR globally on a device, all the device's peer relationships are disconnected, and the device has to renegotiate the GR capability with its peers. You are therefore advised to enable GR for peers in a specified group. Specifically, run this command when GR is not enabled globally, to enable the GR capability and notify the specified peer group of the GR capability. In this manner, the routes and forwarding entries related to the specified peers are not deleted within the GR time, preventing traffic interruption."
