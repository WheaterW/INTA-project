    "ExtraInfo": "In scenarios where servers are partitioned into VMs, to allow flexible deployment and migration of VMs on multiple servers or gateways, the common solution is to configure Layer 2 interworking between multiple gateways. However, this approach may lead to larger Layer 2 domains on the network and risks of broadcast storms. To resolve this problem, a common way is to enable any proxy ND on a VM gateway so that the gateway sends its own MAC address to the source VM and the traffic sent from the source VM to other VMs is transmitted over routes."
