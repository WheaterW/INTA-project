    "ExtraInfo": "When there are multiple redundant links on an IS-IS network, multiple equal-cost routes may exist. That is, there are multiple equal-cost paths to a destination network segment.\nYou can run the nexthop ip-address weight command to set a weight for the next hop so that the next hop can be specified without changing the interface cost. The smaller the weight value, the higher the priority."
