    "ExtraInfo": "In an EVPN over VXLAN scenario, a PE device at one end may fail to establish a VXLAN tunnel because the next hop of the Layer 3 prefix route is unreachable due to incorrect configurations or faults. As a result, services are interrupted. To prevent this problem, run the nexthop recursive-lookup default-route command on the PE and configure the remote PE to send a default route to the local PE. When the next hop of a specific route on the local PE is unreachable, the local PE can iterate the default route to establish a VXLAN tunnel for forwarding, ensuring normal service running."
