    "ExtraInfo": "By default, after the selection parameters (bandwidth, system priority, system ID, port priority, and port number) of a port in the Eth-Trunk interface on the LACP passive end change and then are restored, the selection status of the selected interfaces in the Eth-Trunk corresponding to the Actor remains stable. After the lacp stable-preferred disable command is run, the function to keep the selection status of interfaces stable is disabled."
