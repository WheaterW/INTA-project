    "ExtraInfo": "Network traffic may burst intermittently and a large number of flows are generated in a short period of time. However, the memory capacity of the built-in CPU is limited. Old flow entries in the memory need to be deleted to release memory space for new flow entries. The process of deleting old flow entries is called aging."
