    "ExtraInfo": "The relationship between the matching rules of nodes in the same route-policy is OR. Specifically, if a route matches a node, it matches the route-policy and is no longer matched against other nodes. If you need to match the route against two or more nodes, run the goto next-node command so that the route is further matched against a specified node after the route matches the current node.\nIf node is not specified in the command, the route will be further matched against the next node of the current node by default.\nIf the node specified in the command does not exist, the route will be further matched against the next node of the specified node by default. If the next node of the specified node does not exist either, the route fails to match the route-policy, and no apply clause will be applied to the route."
