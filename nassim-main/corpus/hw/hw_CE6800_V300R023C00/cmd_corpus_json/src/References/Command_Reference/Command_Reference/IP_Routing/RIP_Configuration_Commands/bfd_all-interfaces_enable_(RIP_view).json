    "ExtraInfo": "With the development of technologies, voice, video, and other on-demand services are widely used. These services are sensitive to packet loss and delay. RIP detects neighbor faults through the aging timer. Such fault detection takes a long time. As a result, a large amount of data is lost, and carrier-class network reliability requirements cannot be met. BFD can solve this problem and improve link reliability. You can run the bfd all-interfaces enable command to enable BFD for RIP to quickly detect link faults and implement fast network convergence."
