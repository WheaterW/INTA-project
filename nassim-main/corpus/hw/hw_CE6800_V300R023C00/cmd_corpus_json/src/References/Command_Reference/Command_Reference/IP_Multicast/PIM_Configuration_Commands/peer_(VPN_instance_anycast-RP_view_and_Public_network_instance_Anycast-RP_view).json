    "ExtraInfo": "If PIM Anycast-RP is configured, after an RP receives a Register message from a source designated router (DR), the RP checks the source address of the Register message. If the Register message is sent by the source DR, the RP forwards the Register message to Anycast-RP peers; if the Register message is sent by an Anycast RP peer, the Register message is not forwarded.\nWhen forwarding a Register message, the RP needs to replace the source address of the Register message with the local address of the Anycast RP and replace the destination address of the Register message with the address of the Anycast RP peer. In such a manner, Anycast RP peers can learn source/group information from each other.  This command is used to configure an anycast RP peer address to replace the destination address of the Register message.\nTo obtain information about the multicast source and group outside the PIM domain, use either of the following methods:"
