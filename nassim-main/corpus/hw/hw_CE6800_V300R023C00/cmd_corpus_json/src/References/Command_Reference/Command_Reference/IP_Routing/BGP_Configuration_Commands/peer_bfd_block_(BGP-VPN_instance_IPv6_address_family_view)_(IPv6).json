    "ExtraInfo": "BFD provides millisecond-level fault detection. It helps BGP to detect faults in neighboring devices or links more quickly, and instructs BGP to recalculate routes for correct packet forwarding. If a peer group is configured with BFD, all members of the peer group will establish BFD sessions. The peer bfd block command can be used to prevent a peer from inheriting the BFD function from its peer group."
