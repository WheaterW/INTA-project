The peer advertise link-bandwidth transitive command enables a device to convert the Link Bandwidth extended community attribute (optional non-transitive) carried in BGP routes into an optional transitive attribute before advertising the BGP routes to a specified peer.

If the peer advertise link-bandwidth transitive command is run on the local device for the peer group and the newly added peer does not need to inherit this configuration, you need to run the peer advertise link-bandwidth transitive disable command on the local device for the peer."
