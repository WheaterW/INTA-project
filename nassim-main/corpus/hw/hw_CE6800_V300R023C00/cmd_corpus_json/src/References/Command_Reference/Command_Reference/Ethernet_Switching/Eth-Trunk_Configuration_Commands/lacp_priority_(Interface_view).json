Interfaces with higher priorities are selected as active interfaces.\nTwo devices are connected through three interfaces on each side. After the three interfaces are bundled into an Eth-Trunk interface, the mode lacp-static command is used to configure the Eth-Trunk interface to work in static LACP mode. Two Eth-Trunk member interfaces are active. If you want to use an inactive interface to replace one of the active interfaces, you can take either of the following actions:"
