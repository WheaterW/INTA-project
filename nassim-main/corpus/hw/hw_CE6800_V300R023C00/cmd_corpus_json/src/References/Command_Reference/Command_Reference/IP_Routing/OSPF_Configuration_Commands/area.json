For example, a value of 255 will be converted to 0.0.0.255.For a value of 256 or greater, each X in the format X.X.X.X can be a maximum of 255. Starting from the right-most X, the X to its immediate left increments by 1 each time it reaches 256. For example, a value of 256 will be converted to 0.0.1.0, 511 will be converted to 0.0.1.255, and 65536 will be converted to 0.1.0.0."

    "ExtraInfo": "The number of devices increases with the network expansion, which leads to a large LSDB on each OSPF-enabled device on a large-scale network. Consequently, route flapping frequently occurs, and a large number of OSPF packets are transmitted on the network, which wastes bandwidth resources.\nOSPF addresses the preceding problem by logically partitioning an AS into different areas."
