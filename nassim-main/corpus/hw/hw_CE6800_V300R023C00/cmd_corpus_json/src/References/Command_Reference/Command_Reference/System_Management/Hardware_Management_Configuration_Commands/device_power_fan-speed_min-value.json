    "ExtraInfo": "The fan speed of the power module affects the temperature of the power module. By default, the system automatically adjusts the fan speed of the power supply to ensure that the power supply works at a stable temperature. You can run the device power fan-speed min-value command in the system view to set the minimum fan speed for a power module. In this way, the system can automatically adjust the fan speed to ensure that the fan speed is not lower than the minimum speed."
