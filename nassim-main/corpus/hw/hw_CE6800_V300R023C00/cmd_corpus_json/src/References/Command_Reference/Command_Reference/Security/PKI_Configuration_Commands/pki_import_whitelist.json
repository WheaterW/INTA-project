    "ExtraInfo": "In an LTE scenario, the device establishes tunnels with multiple base stations using certificate negotiation. The certificate whitelist is defined to facilitate unified management of base station certificates, determining the base stations allowed to establish tunnels with the device.\nA certificate whitelist contains common names (CNs) in the certificate subjects of base stations. After PKI certificate whitelist check is enabled, the local device checks whether the CN in the certificate subject of the remote device carried in the received certificate authentication packet matches that in the local certificate whitelist. If not, authentication fails and a tunnel cannot be established between the two devices.\nBefore enabling PKI certificate whitelist check, run the pki import whitelist command to import the certificate whitelist file to the device memory."
