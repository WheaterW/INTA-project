    "ExtraInfo": "When M-LAG is used for dual-homing access on a common Ethernet, VXLAN, or IP network, if the peer-link fails but the DAD status is normal, interfaces excluding the management interface and peer-link interface on one M-LAG device are triggered to enter the error-down state. When the peer-link recovers, the M-LAG member interface in the error-down state automatically restores to the up state after 4 minutes by default, and the other interfaces in the error-down state automatically restore to the up state immediately.\nIn actual networking, however, uplink interfaces running a routing protocol or interfaces at both ends of the DAD link should not enter the error-down state. You can configure this function on interfaces excluding the uplink interfaces and interfaces at both ends of the DAD link based on actual requirements."
