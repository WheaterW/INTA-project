The arp validate command enables an interface to check the consistency between source and destination Media Access Control (MAC) addresses in the Ethernet packet header and those in the data area of an Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) packet.

    "ExtraInfo": "In a Metro Ethernet, various forms of attacks on ARP entries exist. To ensure network security, you need to prevent ARP attacks on the access layer or convergence layer of the network.\nTo prevent ARP spoofing, the arp validate command is used to enable an interface to check the consistency between source and destination MAC addresses in the Ethernet packet header and those in the data area of an ARP packet. If an inconsistency is detected, the ARP packet is directly discarded. If no inconsistency is detected, the ARP packet is accepted.\nWhen using the arp validate command, note the following:"
