    "ExtraInfo": "As the network topology changes, the device learns more and more MAC addresses. To prevent the explosive growth of MAC address entries, you can run the mac-address aging-time command to set a proper aging time for dynamic MAC address entries so that obsolete MAC address entries can be deleted in time. Therefore, you need to configure the MAC address aging timer for the device. If MAC addresses are not updated or the update time exceeds one aging period, the MAC addresses are aged as soon as possible. In actual situations, there is no independent precise timer for each MAC address. Therefore, the aging time of MAC addresses usually has an error. Generally, MAC addresses are aged within one or two aging periods. Note that if a MAC address entry is dynamically learned and is not updated within the specified aging time, the entry is deleted. If a MAC address entry is updated, the aging time of the entry is recalculated. The shorter the aging time is, the more sensitive the device is to the changes of the surrounding network. The longer the aging time is, the less sensitive the device is to the changes of the surrounding network.\nThe aging time of dynamic MAC address entries needs to be set based on the live network conditions and device performance."
