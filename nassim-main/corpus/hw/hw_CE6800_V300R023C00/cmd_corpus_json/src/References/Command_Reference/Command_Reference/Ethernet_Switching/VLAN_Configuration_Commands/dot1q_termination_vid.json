    "ExtraInfo": "Inter-VLAN communication VLAN technology is widely used because it helps Layer 2 packets of different users to be separately transmitted. Hosts in a VLAN can communicate with each other, but hosts in different VLANs cannot communicate at Layer 2. The Layer 3 routing technology is required for communication between hosts in different VLANs. The following interfaces can be used to implement inter-VLAN communication:\nVLANIF interfaces on Layer 3 switches- Layer 3 Ethernet sub-interfaces on devices Conventional Layer 3 Ethernet interfaces do not identify VLAN packets. After receiving VLAN packets, they consider the packets invalid and discard them. To implement inter-VLAN communication, create Ethernet sub-interfaces on an Ethernet interface and configure the sub-interfaces to remove tags from VLAN packets."
