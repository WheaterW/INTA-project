    "ExtraInfo": "The DSCP value is designed to ensure the communication service quality. It is an 8-bit identifier contained in an IP packet header, and identifies service types and priorities.\nWhen network data transmission is stable, Telemetry does not need to change the DSCP value of the data packets sent. When packet loss occurs during data transmission, you can configure a DSCP value in the Telemetry view for the data packets sent. You can improve the priority of packet transmission to ensure the quality of network data transmission."
