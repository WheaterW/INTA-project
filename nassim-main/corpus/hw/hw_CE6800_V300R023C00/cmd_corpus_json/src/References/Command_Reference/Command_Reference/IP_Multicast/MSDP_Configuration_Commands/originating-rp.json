    "ExtraInfo": "To implement Anycast-RP in a PIM-SM domain, you must run the originating-rp command. This is because when a Multicast Source Discovery Protocol (MSDP) peer performs the reverse path forwarding (RPF) check on a received SA message, it discards the message if the RP address in the SA message is the same as the local RP address. To prevent this problem, you need to specify a logical RP address for SA messages on each Router where Anycast-RP is to be deployed."
