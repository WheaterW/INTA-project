The peer enable command enables a BGP device to exchange routes with a specified peer group in the address family view. The undo peer enable command disables a BGP device from exchanging routes with a specified peer group. By default, a device is disabled from exchanging routing information with a specified peer. This command is supported only on the CE6863H, CE6863H-K, CE6860-SAN, CE6866K, CE6866, CE6860-HAM, CE6855-48XS8CQ, CE6885-SAN, CE8850-SAN, CE8855, CE8851-32CQ4BQ, CE8851K, CE8851-32CQ8DQ-P, CE8850-HAM, CE6881H, CE6881H-K, CE6820H, CE6820H-K, CE6820S, CE6885, CE6885-T, CE6885-LL (standard forwarding mode) and CE6863E-48S8CQ.",

    "ExtraInfo": "By default, only peer groups in the BGP-IPv4 unicast address family are automatically enabled to exchange routing information. In other words, after the peer as-number command is run in the BGP view, the system automatically configures the peer enable command. In other address family views, however, this function must be manually enabled."
