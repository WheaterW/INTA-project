The file name is generated automatically and the log format is log.log. You can view the content of a specified information file in the flash: directory or view all files in the specified directory. For details, see \"Example.\"\nIf the size of the existing information file reaches the upper limit, the system transfers the information file into a historical compress file with the name of \"log_SlotID_time.log.zip\". The \"slot ID\" indicates the slot where the log is generated, and \"time\" indicate the date and time when the log was recorded."
