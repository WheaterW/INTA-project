    "ExtraInfo": "In an M-LAG scenario, the active firewall or the ARP/ND connection between the active firewall and the device may be faulty. To ensure network stability, the ARP/ND connection needs to be switched from the active firewall to the standby firewall. In this case, you can run the ip forward backup-group command to configure the two interfaces on the active and standby firewalls to back up each other, implementing a fast and stable ARP/ND connection switchover."
