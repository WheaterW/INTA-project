If a directly connected physical link is unavailable, the peer ebgp-max-hop command must be used to allow EBGP peers to establish a multi-hop connection.\nIf loopback interfaces are used to establish an EBGP peer relationship, the peer ebgp-max-hop command (hop-count greater than or equal to 2) must be run. Otherwise, the EBGP peer relationship cannot be established."
