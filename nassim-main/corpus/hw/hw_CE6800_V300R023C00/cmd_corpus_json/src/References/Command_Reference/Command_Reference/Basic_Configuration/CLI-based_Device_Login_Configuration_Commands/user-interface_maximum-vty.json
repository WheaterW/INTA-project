Otherwise, the system displays a message indicating that the configuration is invalid.\nAfter the configuration is committed, if all VTY channels are occupied, the device does not allow new users to log in through Telnet or SSH. However, users who have logged in are not affected. Telnet has security risks, and SSH v2 is recommended."
