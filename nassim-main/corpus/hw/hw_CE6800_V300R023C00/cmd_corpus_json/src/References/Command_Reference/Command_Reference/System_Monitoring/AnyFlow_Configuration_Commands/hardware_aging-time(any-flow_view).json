    "ExtraInfo": "Network traffic may burst intermittently and a large number of flows are generated in a short period of time. However, the hardware memory capacity is limited. Old flow entries in the memory need to be deleted to release memory space for new flow entries. The process of deleting old flow entries is called aging.\nYou can run this command to set a proper aging time for entries in the hardware flow table. When the active time (from the flow entry creation time to the current time) of a flow entry exceeds the configured aging time, the flow entry will be deleted locally and reported to the chip built in the CPU."
