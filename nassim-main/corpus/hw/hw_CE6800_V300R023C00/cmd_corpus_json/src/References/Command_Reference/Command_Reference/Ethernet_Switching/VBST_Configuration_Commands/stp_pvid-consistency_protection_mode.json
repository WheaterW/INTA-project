The stp pvid-consistency protection mode command configures a protection mode for PVID inconsistency between directly connected ports in VLAN-based Spanning Tree (VBST). The undo stp pvid-consistency protection mode command deletes the protection mode for PVID inconsistency between directly connected ports in VBST.
