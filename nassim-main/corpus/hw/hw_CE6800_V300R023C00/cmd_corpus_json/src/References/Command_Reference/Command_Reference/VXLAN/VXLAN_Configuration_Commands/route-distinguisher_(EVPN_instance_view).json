To allow a peer PE to determine to which EVPN instance a received route belongs, run the route-distinguisher command to configure an RD for the EVPN instance on the local PE. The local PE then adds the RD to the route prefix to be sent to the peer PE, and the route prefix becomes a globally unique EVPN route."
