    "ExtraInfo": "When an ECMP member link fails, the ECMP load balancing consistency function ensures that the forwarding path of a normal link remains unchanged. However, if a faulty member link recovers or a new link is added, traffic is forwarded along another path. The ECMP load balancing consistency function cannot ensure that the original forwarding path remains unchanged. After ECMP load balancing consistency enhancement is enabled using the load-balance ecmp stateful enhanced enable command, if a faulty link is removed, only traffic on the faulty link is hashed again. If a new link is added, not all traffic is hashed again."
