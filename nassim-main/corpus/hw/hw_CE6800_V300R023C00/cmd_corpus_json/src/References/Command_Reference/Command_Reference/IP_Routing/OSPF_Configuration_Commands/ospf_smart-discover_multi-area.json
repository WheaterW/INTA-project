    "ExtraInfo": "Generally, routers periodically send Hello packets through OSPF interfaces to establish and maintain OSPF neighbor relationships and elect a DR or BDR on a multi-access network (broadcast or NBMA network). However, Hello packets are not sent to neighbors until the Hello timer expires, which slows down the establishment of neighbor relationships and DR or BDR election.\nTo address this problem, run the ospf smart-discover multi-area command to enable smart-discover on a multi-area adjacency interface so that Hello packets are sent to neighbors immediately, regardless of the Hello timer."
