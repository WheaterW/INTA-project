By default, a device sends five ICMP echo request messages for a ping operation. You can configure the parameter -c to specify the number of ICMP echo request messages to be sent. If the peer is reachable, it sends five ICMP echo reply messages with the same sequence numbers as those of the ICMP echo request messages.\nIf the network quality is poor, you can increase the parameter value to determine the network quality based on the packet loss rate.\nThe value is an integer ranging from 1 to 4294967295.
