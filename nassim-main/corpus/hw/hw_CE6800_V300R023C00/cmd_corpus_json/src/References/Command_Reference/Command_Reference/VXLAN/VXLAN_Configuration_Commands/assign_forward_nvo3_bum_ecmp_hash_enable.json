    "FuncDef": "The assign forward nvo3 bum ecmp hash enable command enables underlay network-based load balancing of VXLAN broadcast, unknown unicast, and multicast (BUM) packets. The assign forward nvo3 bum ecmp hash enable command enables underlay network-based load balancing of VXLAN broadcast, unknown unicast, and multicast (BUM) packets. By default, VXLAN BUM packets cannot be load balanced based on an underlay network. This command is supported only on the CE6863H, CE6863H-K, CE6881H and CE6881H-K.",
