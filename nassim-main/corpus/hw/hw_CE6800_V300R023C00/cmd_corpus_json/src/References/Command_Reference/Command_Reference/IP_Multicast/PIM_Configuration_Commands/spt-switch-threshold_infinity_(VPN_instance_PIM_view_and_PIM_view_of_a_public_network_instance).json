The spt-switch-threshold infinity command configures the DR to never trigger an SPT switchover. The undo spt-switch-threshold infinity command restores the default value. By default, a receiver's DR performs a switchover from the RPT to the SPT immediately after receiving the first multicast data packet.",

    "ExtraInfo": "In PIM-SM, a source's DR encapsulates multicast data packets in a Register message and sends the Register message to the rendezvous point (RP). The RP then transmits the multicast data along the RPT to receivers. The RP and the receiver's DR are responsible for checking the forwarding rate of multicast data packets.\nIf a rate threshold is configured on the receiver's DR, the receiver's DR sends a Join message to the source only it finds that the forwarding rate of multicast data packets exceeds the threshold and then triggers the switchover from the RPT to the SPT. To set such a rate threshold, run the spt-switch-threshold command.\nThis command takes effect on the Router that functions as the receiver's DR, but does not take effect on the RP."
