    "ExtraInfo": "If unauthorized users use specific tools to send a large number of ARP packets to hosts in the local network segment or other network segments. Many ARP Miss packets are generated because MAC addresses corresponding to the destination IP addresses do not exist. As a result, the CPU will be busy with processing these ARP Miss messages, affecting other services. To resolve this problem, run the arp miss anti-attack rate-limit command to set the limit-value of ARP Miss messages, so that only a specified number of ARP Miss messages will be sent to the device for processing.\nIf unauthorized users send a large number of ARP packets to a device. Many resources are diverted into processing these ARP packets, and the processing of other services is affected.
