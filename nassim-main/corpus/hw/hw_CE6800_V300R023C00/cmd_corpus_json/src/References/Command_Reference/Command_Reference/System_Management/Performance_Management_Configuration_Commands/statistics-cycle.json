    "ExtraInfo": "A specific performance statistics collection interval is set for each performance statistics task. After the performance statistics collection interval is set, bind an instance to the performance statistics task and enable statistics counter measurement so that the system can collect performance statistics at the specified interval. If the statistics interval is set to a small value, the obtained performance statistics are more accurate, but more system resources are consumed.\nAfter the performance statistics collection interval is set using the statistics-cycle command, the system collects performance statistics at the specified interval. The set interval takes effect for all statistics counters of instances of a specified type."
