    "ExtraInfo": "On networks with poor quality and the low transmission rate, increase the timeout period of probe packets so that packets in response to probe packets can be returned. The timeout period is the period for waiting for a response packet after a request packet is sent. If no response packet is received within the timeout period, the test is considered failed.\nThe value of the timeout period depends on the actual networking. If the value is too small, the NQA test instance may fail."
