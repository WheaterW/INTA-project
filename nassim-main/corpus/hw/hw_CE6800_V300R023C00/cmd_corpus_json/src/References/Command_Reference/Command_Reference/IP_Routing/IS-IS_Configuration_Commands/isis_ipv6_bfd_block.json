    "ExtraInfo": "IPv6 BFD can provide millisecond-level fault detection, help IS-IS to detect the faults on neighboring devices more quickly, and instruct IS-IS to recalculate routes for correct packet forwarding. To enable all IS-IS interfaces to dynamically establish IPv6 BFD sessions, run the ipv6 bfd all-interfaces enable command. You can run this command to disable an interface from dynamically establishing IPv6 BFD sessions. To restore the BFD function on an interface, run the undo isis ipv6 bfd block command.\nIf the isis ipv6 bfd enable, isis ipv6 bfd static, or isis ipv6 bfd track session-name command is run on an interface, the corresponding function is disabled after the isis ipv6 bfd block command is run. To restore the configuration, reconfigure the corresponding command on the interface."
