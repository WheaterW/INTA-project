    "ExtraInfo": "OSPF/OSPFv3 IP FRR can rapidly switch traffic from a faulty link to a backup link, ensuring uninterrupted traffic transmission. OSPF/OSPFv3 IP FRR is a method to improve OSPF/OSPFv3 network reliability. After an OSPF or OSPFv3 filtering policy is configured using the frr-policy route command, only the backup OSPF or OSPFv3 routes that meet the filtering conditions can be added to the forwarding table. If the primary link fails, OSPF or OSPFv3 can quickly switch traffic to the backup route."
