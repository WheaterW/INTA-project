Before a DHCP server assigns IP addresses to clients from a global address pool, run the network command to set a network segment address for the global address pool so that the DHCP server can select and assign IP addresses on this network segment to clients. When a DHCP server assigns an IP address to the client from the interface address pool, the network segment of the interface IP address is that of the interface address pool."
