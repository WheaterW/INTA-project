    "ExtraInfo": "Using the summary automatic command, you can summarize the routes imported by BGP. The routes can be direct routes, static routes, RIP routes, OSPF routes, or IS-IS routes. After this command is run, BGP summarizes routes based on the natural network segment (for example, 10.1.1.1/32 and 10.2.1.1/32 are summarized to 10.0.0.0/8, a Class A address), and sends only the summary route to peers. This reduces the amount of routing information."
