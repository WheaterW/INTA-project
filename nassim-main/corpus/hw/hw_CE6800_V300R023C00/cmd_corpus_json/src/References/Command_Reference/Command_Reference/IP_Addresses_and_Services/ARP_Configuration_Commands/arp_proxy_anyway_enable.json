    "ExtraInfo": "In scenarios where servers are partitioned into multiple VMs, to allow flexible deployment and migration of VMs on multiple servers or devices, the common solution is to configure Layer 2 interconnection between multiple devices. However, this approach may lead to larger Layer 2 domains on the network and the risk of broadcast storms. To resolve this problem, the common method is to configure a VM gateway on an access device and enable proxy ARP anyway on the gateway so that the gateway sends its own MAC address to a source VM and communication between VMs is implemented through route forwarding. To enable proxy ARP anyway on an interface, run the arp proxy anyway enable command."
