    "ExtraInfo": "If devices in a VRRP group use different VRRP versions, the VRRP group may fail to negotiate the status. This is because a VRRPv2-enabled device can only receive VRRPv2 Advertisement packets and discards the received VRRPv3 Advertisement packets. To resolve this issue, run the vrrp vrid compatible-version command to configure a VRRPv3-enabled device to send VRRPv2 Advertisement packets so that the VRRPv2- and VRRPv3-enabled devices can negotiate their status."
