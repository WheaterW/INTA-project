    "ExtraInfo": "When replacing a TRILL network with a VXLAN network, you need to configure multiple VXLAN-related commands in each BD. Even if you bind a BD profile to a BD to simplify the configuration, the configuration is difficult when a large number of BDs are required. In addition, manual configuration or maintenance by the network administrator is labor-intensive and cannot ensure configuration consistency. To improve maintenance efficiency and simplify configuration, run the bridge-domain range command to create a temporary BD range and bind a BD profile to the BD range. After the binding is successful, the configuration is delivered to all BDs in the BD range in batches."
