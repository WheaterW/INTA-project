    "ExtraInfo": "BGP uses TCP as the transport layer protocol. To improve BGP security, you can perform MD5 authentication when establishing a TCP connection. In MD5 authentication of BGP, only the MD5 authentication password is set for the TCP connection, and the authentication is performed by TCP.\nA password can be set in plaintext or ciphertext mode. The two modes determine how the password is saved in the configuration file."
