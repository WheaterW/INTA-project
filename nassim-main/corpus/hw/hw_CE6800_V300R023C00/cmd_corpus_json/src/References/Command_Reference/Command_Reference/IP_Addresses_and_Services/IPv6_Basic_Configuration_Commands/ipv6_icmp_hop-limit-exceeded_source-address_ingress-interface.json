    "ExtraInfo": "Tracert is used to test the path through which a packet is sent from a host to the destination. After receiving the packet, an intermediate device sends an ICMPv6 Time Exceeded message to the host. The host then identifies the device according to the source IPv6 address of the ICMPv6 Time Exceeded message. To easily observe the inbound interface of a device along the path, you can forcibly configure the IPv6 address of the inbound interface for forwarding packets as the source address of an ICMPv6 Time Exceeded message."
