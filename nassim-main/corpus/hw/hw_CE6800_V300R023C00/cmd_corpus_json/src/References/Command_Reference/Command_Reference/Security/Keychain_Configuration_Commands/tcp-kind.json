    "ExtraInfo": "A keychain ensures a secure protocol packet transmission by changing the authentication algorithm and key dynamically. Packets to be transmitted over non-TCP and TCP connections are authenticated using the authentication and encryption algorithms corresponding to a key ID. The two connections differ in that the TCP connection needs to be authenticated to enhance the security.\nTCP connection request packets carry enhanced authentication options and are authenticated by a specified authentication algorithm. At present, different vendors use different kind values to specify the enhanced authentication option. Kind values configured for two communication devices must be identical."
