    "ExtraInfo": "The formula for calculating the cost of an OSPF interface is as follows: Interface cost = Bandwidth reference value/Interface bandwidth. The bandwidth unit is bit/s. If the calculation result is greater than 1, the integer part of the calculation result is used as the interface cost. If the calculation result is less than 1, the interface cost is 1. For example, if the calculation result is 0.3, the interface cost is 1. If the calculation result is 2.3, the interface cost is 2. Therefore, you can run the bandwidth-reference command to set the bandwidth reference value to change the cost of an interface and adjust OSPF route selection. By default, the bandwidth reference value is 100 Mbit/s, that is, cost=100000000/bandwidth."
