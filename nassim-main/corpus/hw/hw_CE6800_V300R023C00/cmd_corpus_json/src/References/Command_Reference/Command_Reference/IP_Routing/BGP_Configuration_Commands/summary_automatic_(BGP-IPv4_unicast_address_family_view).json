    "ExtraInfo": "In the BGP IPv4 unicast address family view, the summary automatic command configures BGP to automatically summarize locally imported routes on the public network.\nThe summary automatic command is used to summarize the routes imported by BGP. The routes can be direct routes, static routes, RIP routes, OSPF routes, or IS-IS routes. After this command is run, BGP summarizes routes based on the natural network segment (for example, 10.1.1.1/32 and 10.2.1.1/32 are summarized to 10.0.0.0/8, a Class A address), and sends only the summary route to peers. This reduces the amount of routing information."
