    "ExtraInfo": "A wavelength of an optical wave directly determines transmission quality and efficiency of an optical fiber. Setting a wavelength of an optical wave used in optical communication may enable an optical fiber to more flexibly use different transmission modes in different situations. The system has 80 channels, each corresponding to a wavelength. Before setting the center wavelength of a colored optical module, you can run the display wavelength-map command to view the mapping between the channel number and center wavelength of the colored optical module, and then run the wavelength-channel <channel> command to set the channel number corresponding to the center wavelength of the colored optical module."
