    "ExtraInfo": "This command applies to DHCP servers. When a DHCP server allocates IP addresses to clients, IP address conflict may occur because IP addresses of some hosts have been manually configured. In this case, the DHCP server considers these IP addresses as conflicting IP addresses, and allocates available IP addresses from the conflicting IP addresses to clients only after available IP addresses in the address pool are used up. To reclaim conflicting IP addresses promptly, the administrator can run this command to enable automatic reclaim of conflicting IP addresses and specify the reclaim interval. The automatic reclaim timer is started after the configuration is delivered. When the configured interval expires, all conflicting IP addresses in the address pool are automatically reclaimed."
