If there are Level-1 and Level-2 devices on this network, Level-1 and Level-2 DISs are elected separately and can be the same device or different devices.\nThe DIS is elected as follows: The device whose IS-IS interface has the highest DIS priority is elected as the DIS; If the interfaces on multiple devices have the same DIS priority, the device whose interface has the largest MAC address is elected as the DIS.\nThe isis dis-priority command can be used to set a DIS Priority for an IS-IS interface."
