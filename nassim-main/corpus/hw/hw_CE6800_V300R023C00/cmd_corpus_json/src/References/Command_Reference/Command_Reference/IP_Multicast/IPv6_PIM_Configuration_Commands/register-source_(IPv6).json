    "ExtraInfo": "If the source's DR uses more than one or a filtered out IPv6 address to send Register messages to the rendezvous point (RP), errors occur in the registration process and extra traffic occupies bandwidth on the network. To address this issue, run the register-source command to specify an IPv6 unicast address (a loopback interface's address is recommended) using which the source's DR sends Register messages."
