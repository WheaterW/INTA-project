    "ExtraInfo": "When multiple traffic classifiers are defined in a traffic policy and traffic behaviors associated with the traffic classifiers define CAR (using the car cir command) and aggregated CAR, the system limits the rates of flows using the configured CAR, aggregates the flows, and limits the rate of the aggregated traffic using the aggregated CAR in sequence. This process is called hierarchical traffic policing."
