    "ExtraInfo": "If Huawei and non-Huawei data communication devices are deployed on a network running STP, the Huawei and non-Huawei devices may fail to communicate with each other, because they have different Proposal/Agreement mechanisms. To address this problem, run the stp no-agreement-check or undo stp no-agreement-check command to set a common or enhanced fast transition mechanism based on the Proposal/Agreement mechanism of the non-Huawei device."
