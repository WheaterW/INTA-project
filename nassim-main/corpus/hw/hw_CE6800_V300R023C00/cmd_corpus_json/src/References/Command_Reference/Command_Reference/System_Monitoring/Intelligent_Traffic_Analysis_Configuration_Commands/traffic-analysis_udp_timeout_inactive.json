    "ExtraInfo": "After intelligent traffic analysis for UDP flows is enabled, the TAP exports the flow table that contains flow analysis results to the specified TDA for further processing and graphical display of the flow information.\nWhen a UDP flow is continuously received, analysis results of the UDP flow are periodically sent to the TDA based on the block granularity. However, when the inactive time (the time from when the last UDP packet is received to the current time) of the UDP flow exceeds the configured inactive aging period, the switch considers that the UDP flow is inactive (the flow is interrupted). In this case, the switch forcibly sends the current flow table to the TDA and deletes it from the switch. This process is called inactive aging."
