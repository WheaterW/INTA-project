    "ExtraInfo": "To disable a device from processing protocol packets, run the protocol-transparent command to enable VLAN protocol-transparent on the device.\nTransparent transmission of VLAN protocol packets allows protocol packets from a VLAN to be directly forwarded without being processed by the CPU of the device. This improves the performance of the device, enhances network security, and reduces the probability that the device is attacked by malicious users."
