These routes can back up each other or load-balance traffic, thereby ensuring data transmission reliability.\nWhen deploying BGP Add-Path, run the peer capability-advertise add-path command to enable the device to advertise Add-Path routes to a specified BGP peer or receive Add-Path routes from a specified BGP peer. In addition, you need to run the peer advertise add-path command to configure the number of routes that the device can advertise to a specified peer."
