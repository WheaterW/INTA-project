    "ExtraInfo": "Generally, BGP uses AS numbers to detect routing loops. The AS numbers in the AS_Path of each received route are matched against the local AS number configured using the bgp command and the fake AS number configured using the peer fake-as command. The largest number of times any of the configured AS numbers is repeated is considered as the maximum number. In Hub-Spoke networking, if EBGP runs between the PE and CE at the Hub site, the routing information advertised by the Hub-PE to the Hub-CE carries the AS number of the local AS. When the Hub-PE receives a route update message from the Hub-CE, the route update message carries the AS number of the local AS. As a result, the Hub-PE cannot receive the route update message.\nTo ensure correct route transmission in Hub-Spoke networking, configure the BGP peers through which the VPN routes are advertised from the Hub-CE to the Spoke-CE to allow routes with the AS number repeated once in the AS_Path attribute to pass through."
