    "ExtraInfo": "BGP uses AS numbers to detect routing loops. The AS numbers in the AS_Path of each received route are matched against the local AS number configured using the bgp command and the fake AS number configured using the peer fake-as command. The largest number of times any of the configured AS numbers is repeated is considered as the maximum number. In the Hub and Spoke networking, if EBGP runs between a Hub-PE and a Hub-CE on a Hub site, the route sent from the Hub-PE to the Hub-CE carries the AS number of the Hub-PE. If the Hub-CE sends a routing update to the Hub-PE, the Hub-PE will deny it because the routing update contains the AS number of the Hub-PE.\nTo ensure proper route transmission in the Hub and Spoke networking, configure all the BGP peers on the path, along which the Hub-CE advertises private network routes to the Spoke-CE, to accept the routes in which the AS number repeats once."
