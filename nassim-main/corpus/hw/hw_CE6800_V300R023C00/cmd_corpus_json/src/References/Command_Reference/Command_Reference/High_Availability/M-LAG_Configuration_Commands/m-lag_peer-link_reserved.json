The m-lag peer-link reserved command configures the VLAN to contain only the peer-link interface.

    "ExtraInfo": "To enable traffic and protocol packets in a VLAN to be forwarded only through the peer-link (but not through other Layer 2 interfaces), run the m-lag peer-link reserved command. For example, in the multicast scenario where an M-LAG is connected to a Layer 3 network, if the upstream device or link of the M-LAG fails, multicast traffic and protocol packets are forwarded only through the peer-link of the VLAN."
