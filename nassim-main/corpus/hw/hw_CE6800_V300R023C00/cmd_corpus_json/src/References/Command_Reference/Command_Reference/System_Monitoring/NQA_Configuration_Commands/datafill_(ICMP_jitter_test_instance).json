    "ExtraInfo": "To fill special padding characters into the Data field of the test packets to be sent for identification, run the datafill command.\nFor example, if a test packet sent in an ICMP test instance is destined for a port that does not exist, the destination that receives the test packet replies to the transmit end with a port unreachable packet containing the contents of the test packet. The transmit end will receive a great number of reply packets, but it can identify different test instances based on the padding characters."
