Related standards define keyed hash-based message authentication code (HMAC), which is an effective tool that uses a security hash function and a key to generate a message authentication code, and is widely applied in the Internet. SNMP uses six types of HMACs: HMAC-MD5-96, HMAC-SHA-96, HMAC-SHA2-224, HMAC-SHA2-256, HMAC-SHA2-384, and HMAC-SHA2-512.\nmd5: HMAC-MD5-96 (Hashed Message Authentication Code for Message Digest 5-96) is used as the authentication protocol.sha: HMAC-SHA-96 is used as the authentication protocol.sha2-224: HMAC-SHA2-224 is used as the authentication protocol.sha2-256: HMAC-SHA2-256 is used as the authentication protocol.sha2-384: HMAC-SHA2-384 is used as the authentication protocol.sha2-512: HMAC-SHA2-512 is used as the authentication protocol.SHA2-256 and more complex algorithms are more secure than SHA2-224, SHA, and MD5, and are therefore recommended."
