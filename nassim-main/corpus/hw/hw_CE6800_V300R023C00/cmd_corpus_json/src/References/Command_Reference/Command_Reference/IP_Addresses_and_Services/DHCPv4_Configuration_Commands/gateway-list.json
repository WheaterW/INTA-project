    "ExtraInfo": "This command applies to DHCP servers. If a DHCP server and its client are on different network segments, you can run the gateway-list command to specify an egress gateway address. In this way, the DHCP server and client can communicate with each other. Then the DHCP server can assign both an IP address and the specified egress gateway address to the client. You can configure multiple gateways in a global address pool to load balance traffic and improve network reliability."
