    "ExtraInfo": "Link-local addresses are used for the communications between link-local nodes in either the neighbor discovery or the stateless auto-configuration process. The packets with link-local addresses being the source or destination addresses are not forwarded to other links, that is, link-local addresses are valid only on local links.\nYou can also run the ipv6 address link-local command to manually configure a link-local address for an interface.\nTo enable IPv6 SEND to protect ND messages that carry CGA and RSA options, you need to configure a CGA IPv6 address on the interface. Running the ipv6 address link-local command with the keyword cga generates a CGA IPv6 link-local address."
