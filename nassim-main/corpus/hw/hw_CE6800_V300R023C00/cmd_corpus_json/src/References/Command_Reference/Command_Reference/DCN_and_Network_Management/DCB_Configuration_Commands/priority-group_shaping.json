    "ExtraInfo": "When the rate of an interface on a downstream device is lower than that of an interface on an upstream device, traffic congestion may occur on the interface of the downstream device. In this case, you can configure traffic shaping for priority groups on the outbound interface of the upstream device and adjust the transmit rates of the priority groups."
