Traffic transmitted on each device interface contains different 5-tuple information. If the outbound interface is an Eth-Trunk or packets have multiple ECMP next hops, you can use this command to check statistics on packets containing specified 5-tuple information (including the outbound interface), facilitating fault locating and traffic forwarding path identification."
