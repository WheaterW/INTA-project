    "ExtraInfo": "Monitor Link is an interface association mechanism. Monitor Link checks the uplink interface in a Monitor Link group and sets the downlink interface status accordingly. After an uplink fault occurs, Monitor Link immediately notifies downstream devices of the fault. This process minimizes traffic loss by avoiding a delayed notification of the uplink fault. To configure basic functions of Monitor Link, run the monitor-link group command to create a Monitor Link group and enter the Monitor Link group view."
