    "ExtraInfo": "If a multicast link fails, services are interrupted before unicast routes are converged. Route convergence generally takes a long time, which is unacceptable by multicast services that have high requirements on real-time data transmission. To resolve this problem, configure PIM FRR. After PIM FRR is configured, PIM sets up primary and backup MDTs based on unicast backup FRR routes, allowing multicast traffic transmission through both the primary and backup links. The device's forwarding plane permits the multicast traffic on the primary link and discards that on the backup link. However, the forwarding plane permits the multicast traffic on the backup link immediately after the primary link fails, thus minimizing traffic loss.\nYou can specify an ACL to enable PIM FRR for the specified entry."
