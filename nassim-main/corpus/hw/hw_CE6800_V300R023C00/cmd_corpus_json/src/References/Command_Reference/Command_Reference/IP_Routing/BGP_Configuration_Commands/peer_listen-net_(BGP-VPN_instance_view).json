    "ExtraInfo": "On a BGP network, if multiple peers frequently change, the establishment of peer relationships changes accordingly. If you use the common peer configuration mode, you need to frequently add or delete peer configurations on the local end, which increases the maintenance workload. In this case, you can configure the dynamic BGP peer function and specify a network segment from which a dynamic peer group listens for connection requests. After receiving connection requests, BGP dynamically establishes BGP peer relationships and adds these peers to the same dynamic peer group. In this manner, when one of the peers changes, you do not need to add or delete BGP peer configurations on the local end, which reduces the workload of network maintenance. The peer listen-net command specifies a network segment from which a dynamic BGP peer group listens for BGP connection requests."
