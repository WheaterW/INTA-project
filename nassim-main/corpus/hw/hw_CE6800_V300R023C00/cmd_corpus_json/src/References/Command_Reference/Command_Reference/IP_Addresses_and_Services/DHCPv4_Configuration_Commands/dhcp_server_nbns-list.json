    "ExtraInfo": "This command applies to DHCP servers. Before hosts communicate with each other, a NetBIOS server needs to resolve the accessed NetBIOS hostname to an IP address. To enable hosts to communicate with each other, run the dhcp server nbns-list command to configure NetBIOS server addresses for an interface address pool. When assigning IP addresses to clients, a DHCP server also assigns the configured NetBIOS server addresses to clients. To configure NetBIOS server addresses for a global address pool, run the nbns-list command."
