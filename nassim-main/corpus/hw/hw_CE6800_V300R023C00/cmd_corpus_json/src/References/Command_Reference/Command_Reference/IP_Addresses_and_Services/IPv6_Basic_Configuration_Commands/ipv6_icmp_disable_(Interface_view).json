    "ExtraInfo": "On a normal network, a device can correctly send or receive ICMPv6 messages; however, when network traffic load is heavy, host unreachable or port unreachable events frequently occur and devices need to send a large number of ICMPv6 messages, which burdens the network and degrades the performance of the devices. In addition, attackers usually use ICMPv6 error messages to probe the internal network topology illegitimately."
