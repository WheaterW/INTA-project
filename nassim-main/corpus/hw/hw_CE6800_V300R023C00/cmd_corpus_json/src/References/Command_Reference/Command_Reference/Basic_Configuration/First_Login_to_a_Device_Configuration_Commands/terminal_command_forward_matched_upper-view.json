    "ExtraInfo": "When configuring services, you need to enter the view of the command to be configured to complete the configuration. In this case, you need to run the quit command repeatedly to exit the current view and enter the required view. The intelligent rollback function allows you to run commands of other views in the current view to reduce repeated quit operations.Intelligent rollback enables the system to automatically return to the previous view if a command fails to be executed in the current view. The system continues to attempt to return to the required view until it returns to the system view. If the command is successfully matched, the command is run in the current view and the corresponding view is displayed.This function is valid only for sessions where this command is executed.If you do not need to use the intelligent rollback function, run the undo terminal command forward matched upper-view command to disable the function."
