    "ExtraInfo": "On a Layer 2 network running MSTP, a device clears ARP entries and MAC entries after receiving TC BPDUs. If a device receives too many TC BPDUs, the device will frequently clear ARP entries and MAC entries, causing high CPU usage. As a result, network traffic is unstable.\nYou can run the display stp topology-change command to display statistics about MSTP topology changes. If the statistics increase, network flapping occurs."
