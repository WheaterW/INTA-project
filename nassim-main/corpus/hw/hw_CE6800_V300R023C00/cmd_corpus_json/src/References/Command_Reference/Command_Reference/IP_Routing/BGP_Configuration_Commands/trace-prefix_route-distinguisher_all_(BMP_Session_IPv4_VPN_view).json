As a result, you can only manually query the trace data of the device's BGP routes.\nTo resolve this issue, run the trace-prefix route-distinguisher all command on the device after a connection is established between the device and BMP server. The command configures BMP to monitor the trace data of all VPNv4 routes and IPv4 VPN unicast routes (transformed from the VPNv4 routes) in real time. After the configuration, BMP can monitor how the routes are processed in response to the following main items:"
