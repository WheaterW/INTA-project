    "ExtraInfo": "If the status of the interface on which the VRRP group is configured frequently changes, the VRRP status frequently flaps. To prevent this problem, run the vrrp recover-delay command to set a status recovery delay to suppress VRRP group flapping.\nWhen a device or board is restarted and a large number of services are configured, the backup device may not immediately receive protocol packets from the master device after the restart. As a result, the backup device becomes the master device because it does not receive protocol packets within a specified period, causing VRRP status flapping or the configured preemption delay to fail to take effect. To prevent this problem, run the vrrp recover-delay command to set a status recovery delay for the VRRP group."
