    "ExtraInfo": "If an attacker sends a large number of ND packets to a device within a short period, the device consumes many CPU resources to learn and respond to ND entries, affecting the processing of other services. To resolve this issue, configure a rate limit for sending ND packets to the CPU. After the configuration is complete, the device counts the number of ND packets received per period based on source IP addresses. If the number of ND packets exceeds the configured limit, the device does not process excess ND packets."
