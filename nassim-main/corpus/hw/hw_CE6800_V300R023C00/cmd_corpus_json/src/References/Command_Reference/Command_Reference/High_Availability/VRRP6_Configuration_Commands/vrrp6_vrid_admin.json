To resolve this issue, run the admin-vrrp6 vrid command to create an mVRRP6 backup group or specifies an existing common VRRP6 backup group as an mVRRP6 backup group. The mVRRP6 backup group processes VRRP packets and determines the status of the common VRRP6 backup groups bound to it.\nConfiguration parameters are required in the following scenario:"
