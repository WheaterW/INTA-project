    "ExtraInfo": "BFD can provide millisecond-level fault detection, help IS-IS to detect the faults that occur on neighboring devices or links more quickly,and instruct IS-IS to recalculate routes for correct packet forwarding. To enable all IS-IS interfaces to dynamically establish BFD sessions, run the bfd all-interfaces enable command on the interfaces. To disable an interface from dynamically establishing BFD sessions, run the isis bfd block command."
