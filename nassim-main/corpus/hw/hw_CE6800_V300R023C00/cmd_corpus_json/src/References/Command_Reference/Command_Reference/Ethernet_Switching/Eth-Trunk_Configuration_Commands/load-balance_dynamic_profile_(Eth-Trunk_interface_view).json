    "ExtraInfo": "The traditional static load balancing mode does not consider the usage of each member link, and unbalanced loads of member links may occur. Especially, when there are large flows, congestion or even packet loss may occur on member links.\nAfter the dynamic load balancing function is enabled, traffic of a LAG is dynamically load balanced among its member links, providing maximum load balancing between them."
