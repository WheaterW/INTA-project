The memory-usage reliability switch on command enables the memory overload reliability function. The undo memory-usage reliability switch on command disables the memory overload reliability function. By default, the memory overload reliability function is disabled. This command is supported only on the CE6860-SAN, CE6866K, CE6866, CE6860-HAM, CE8850-SAN, CE8851K, CE8851-32CQ8DQ-P and CE8850-HAM.",

    "ExtraInfo": "To enable the system to notify users of the top 3 components with the highest memory usage when memory usage is overloaded and to reset the PROTO1 process to improve memory reliability if this process has the highest memory usage, run the memory-usage reliability switch on command to enable the memory overload reliability function.\nWith this function enabled, when the memory usage of a board exceeds the level-1 overload threshold, the system notifies users of the top 3 components to which processes with the highest memory usage belong. When the memory usage of the board exceeds the level-2 overload threshold, the system notifies users of the process with the highest memory usage. If this process is the PROTO1 process, the system resets the process."
