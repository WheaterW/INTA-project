    "ExtraInfo": "If downlink interfaces go Up and Down constantly due to intermittent uplink disconnections, packet forwarding and system performance will be affected. To address this problem, run the timer recover-time command to set the WTR time of the Monitor Link group. When the uplink recovers, Monitor Link does not recover downlink interfaces until the WTR time expires, reducing the impact on system performance due to constant changes of the downlink interface status."
