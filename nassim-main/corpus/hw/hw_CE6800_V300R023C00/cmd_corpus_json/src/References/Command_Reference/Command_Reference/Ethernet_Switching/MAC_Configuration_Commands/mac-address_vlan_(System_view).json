    "ExtraInfo": "MAC address table capacity attack\nThe attack source sends packets with different source MAC addresses to a network device. After receiving these packets, the network device learns the source MAC addresses. Since the capacity of a MAC address table is limited, when the number of the MAC addresses in the MAC address table reaches the limit, the source MAC addresses of valid packets cannot be learned. These packets sent from the attack source are also broadcast in the VLAN, consuming lots of bandwidth on the network. This may also affect the hosts attached to the network device.MAC address entry attack\nWhen a device learns source MAC addresses and creates a MAC address table, the system cannot identify whether the packets are from authorized users or hackers. This brings security threats. If hackers send attack packets with forged source MAC addresses and access a device through other interfaces, the device will learn incorrect MAC address entries. As a result, the packets that should be forwarded to authorized users are forwarded to hackers.\nTo improve interface security, a network administrator can run the mac-address static command to add specific MAC address entries to the MAC address table. User devices are bound to interfaces to prevent unauthorized users from obtaining data."
