    "ExtraInfo": "In an IS-IS dual-homing access scenario, if user traffic exceeds the link bandwidth, multiple links are required to forward user traffic. If one or more links fail and the total bandwidth of other links is less than the user traffic volume, some traffic is lost. To prevent this problem, run the link-group command to bind multiple links to a link group. When one or more links fail, the cost of all member links is adjusted. In this manner, traffic forwarding paths are changed, preventing traffic loss. cost-offset specifies the cost to be adjusted."
