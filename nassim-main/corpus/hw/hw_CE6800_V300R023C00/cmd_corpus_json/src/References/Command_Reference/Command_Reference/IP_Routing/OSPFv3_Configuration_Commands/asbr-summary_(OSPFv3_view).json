    "ExtraInfo": "Routes with the same IPv6 prefix can be summarized into a single route. On a large-scale OSPFv3 network, route lookup may slow down because of the large size of the routing table. To reduce the routing table size and simplify management, configure route summarization. Route summarization also prevents route flapping and improves network stability. If a link associated with a summary IPv6 address prefix frequently alternates between up and down, this function prevents the changes from being advertised to devices whose IPv6 addresses do not belong to the prefix of the summary route. If route summarization is configured on an ASBR using the asbr-summary command, the ASBR summarizes routes of all imported Type 5 LSAs within the summary address range. If a large number of routes with the same IPv6 prefix are imported, you can run the asbr-summary command to summarize them into one route.\nWhen a large number of summary routes exist, specify the distribute-delay parameter to set a delay in advertising the summary routes. This ensures that the advertised summary routes contain more valid routes and avoids network flapping and incorrect routing information.\nWhen OSPFv3 imports external routes and specific routes have been advertised, if the distribute-delay parameter is specified in the asbr-summary command, the specific routes are not withdrawn immediately. After the delay expires, the specific routes are withdrawn and the summary route is advertised.\nIf the distribute-delay parameter is specified in the asbr-summary command for OSPFv3 route summarization and then external routes are imported, specific routes and the summary route are not advertised before the delay expires. The summary route is advertised only after the delay expires."
