    "ExtraInfo": "By default, only peer groups in the BGP-IPv4 unicast address family are automatically enabled to exchange routing information. In other words, after the peer as-number command is run in the BGP view, the system automatically configures the peer enable command. In other address family views, however, this function must be manually enabled."
