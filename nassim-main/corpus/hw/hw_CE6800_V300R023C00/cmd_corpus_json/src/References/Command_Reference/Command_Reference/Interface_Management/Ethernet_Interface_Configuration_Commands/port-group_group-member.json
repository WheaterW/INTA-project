    "ExtraInfo": "A switching device provides multiple interfaces, many of which have the same configuration. To simplify the configuration of interfaces, run the port-group command to create a permanent interface group and add interfaces to the permanent interface group. When you run a command in the interface group view, the system automatically applies the command to all the interfaces in the permanent interface group. In this manner, interfaces in a permanent interface group are configured in a batch.\nIf some interfaces need to be temporarily configured in a batch, run the port-group group-member command to create a temporary interface group. After you complete the batch configuration and exit the view of the temporary interface group, the temporary interface group is automatically deleted."
