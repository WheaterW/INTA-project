    "ExtraInfo": "By default, after receiving a route from an EBGP peer in AS 200, the local device in AS 100 advertises the route to all EBGP peers in AS 200. After the peer peer-as-check command is run, the local device does not advertise the routes learned from an EBGP peer to the peers in a peer group with the same AS number as that of the EBGP peer. This reduces BGP memory and CPU consumption and shortens route convergence time during route flapping."
