    "ExtraInfo": "After a user goes offline, the device sends an accounting-stop packet to an accounting server. After the accounting server receives the accounting-stop packet, it stops accounting for the user. If the accounting server does not receive the accounting-stop packet because of network faults, it continues to perform accounting for the user. As a result, the user is charged incorrectly. To solve this problem, configure the device to send accounting-stop packets multiple times."
