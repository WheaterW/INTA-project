    "ExtraInfo": "If a router ID conflict occurs between indirectly connected devices in an OSPF area, the system can reselect a router ID to complete automatic router ID recovery. This prevents route flapping, reduces the route calculation frequency, and prevents other protocol disconnections caused by high CPU usage."
