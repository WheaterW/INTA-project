An alarm is reported if the relevant fault persists after the suppression period expires; a clear alarm is reported if the relevant fault is rectified during the suppression period.\nAlarm suppression is used to suppress the managed nodes that generate repeated alarms, service intermittence alarms, and persistent alarms so as to prevent a large number of invalid alarms."
