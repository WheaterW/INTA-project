    "ExtraInfo": "During routing protocol convergence, the outbound and inbound interfaces of some Layer 3 traffic are the same, namely, a loop occurs temporarily. After Layer 3 port isolation is configured, Layer 3 forwarding traffic whose outbound and inbound interfaces are the same is discarded on the outbound interface to prevent the loop. After Layer 3 port isolation is enabled, only Layer 3 traffic is isolated."
