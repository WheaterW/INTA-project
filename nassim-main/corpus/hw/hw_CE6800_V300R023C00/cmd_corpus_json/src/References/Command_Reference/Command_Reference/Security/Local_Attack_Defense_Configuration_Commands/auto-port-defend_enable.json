    "ExtraInfo": "If an attacker initiates a DoS attack on a port, the malicious attack packets sent from this port to the CPU occupy bandwidth. As a result, the CPU cannot process the protocol packets sent from other ports, and services are interrupted.\nThe port attack defense function effectively limits the number of packets sent to the CPU, and prevents DoS attacks aiming at the CPU.\nThis function is enabled by default. You can enable port-based automatic local attack defense to resolve the problem. When the number of protocol packets received by a port exceeds the threshold for port attack defense or the sum of the top two quantities of protocol packets received on two ports exceeds the threshold for port attack defense, the protocol packets received by the ports are sent to a queue with a smaller CAR value. This prevents impacts on the sending of protocol packets on other normal ports."
