    "ExtraInfo": "In two-phase validation mode, you can run the commit trial command to enable configuration trial run after a configuration command is configured. You can also specify the time parameter in the commit trial command to set the timeout period of the trial run. After the trial run times out, the system configuration is automatically rolled back to the state before the trial run. Before the trial run times out, you can run the abort trial command to stop the trial run and roll back the system configuration to the state before the trial run. You can also specify the session parameter in the abort trial command to specify a session to end the trial run initiated by the session. You can specify the persistId parameter to end the persistent configuration trial run."
