    "ExtraInfo": "After the dhcp snooping packet-flow log enable command is run to enable the log function for DHCP message exchange on a device, the device records each received DHCP message in the DHCPSNP/6/SNP_RCV_MSG log, which contains DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 message information and can be used in scenarios such as intelligent O&M. The network analyzer uses this log to intelligently analyze why users fail to obtain IP addresses."
