    "ExtraInfo": "TLVs are the basic information units of Link Layer Discovery Protocol Data Units (LLDPDUs), where T, L, and V indicate the information type, length, and value, respectively. The device encapsulates information such as the main capability, management address, device ID, and interface ID into TLVs, encapsulates the TLVs into LLDPDUs, and then encapsulates the LLDPDUs into LLDP packets to be exchanged with the directly connected neighboring node. During the process of exchanging LLDP packets between devices, the LLDPDU encapsulated in an LLDP packet carries different TLVs as required. A device sends its information and receives the neighbor node's information based on these different TLVs."
