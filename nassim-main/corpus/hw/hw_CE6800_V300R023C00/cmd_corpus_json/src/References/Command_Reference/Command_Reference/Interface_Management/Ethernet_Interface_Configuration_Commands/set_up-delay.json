    "ExtraInfo": "The physical status of an Ethernet interface can be Up or Down. When the interface physical status changes, the system notifies upper-layer protocol modules (such as the routing and forwarding modules) of the change to direct packet receiving and forwarding. The system also automatically generates traps and logs to remind users to perform corresponding operations on physical links.\nAfter the device restarts or a subcard resets, the physical status of interfaces is Up. However, the upper-layer protocol modules do not meet forwarding requirements. If an interface receives service packets and sends the packets to the upper-layer protocol modules. The services cannot run properly because the upper-layer protocol modules cannot process the service packets. You can run the set up-delay command to set the delay after which the interface goes Up. The interface then becomes physically Up after the upper-layer protocol modules meet forwarding requirements, ensuring that packets can be processed."
