    "ExtraInfo": "Route dampening is enabled to solve the problem of route instability. In most situations, BGP is applied to complex networks where routes change frequently. Route dampening is then used to suppress unstable routes.\nThe reset bgp dampening command is used to clear dampening information about specified routes on the public network and release specified suppressed routes. If no IP address is specified in the command, dampening information about all routes on the public network is cleared and all suppressed routes are released."
