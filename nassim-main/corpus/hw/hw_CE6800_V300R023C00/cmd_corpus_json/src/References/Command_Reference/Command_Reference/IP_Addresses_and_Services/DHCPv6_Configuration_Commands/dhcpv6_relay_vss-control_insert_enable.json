    "ExtraInfo": "If a DHCPv6 client and server are located in different VPNs, you must run this command on the DHCPv6 relay agent. The DHCPv6 relay agent inserts the VSS-Control option into a Relay-forward message and sends the option to the remote DHCPv6 server. The option carries information about the VPN to which the client belongs. The DHCPv6 server then searches for the corresponding address pool based on the option and allocates an address to the client."
