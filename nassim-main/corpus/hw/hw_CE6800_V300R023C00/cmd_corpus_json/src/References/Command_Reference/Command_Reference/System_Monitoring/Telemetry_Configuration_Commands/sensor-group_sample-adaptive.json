    "ExtraInfo": "Generally, a small sampling interval is set for an analyzer to obtain more accurate data for analysis. However, a large amount of redundant data is generated when a small sampling interval is used. The data requires a large amount of storage space and is inconvenient for data management. If adaptive sampling is configured, telemetry dynamically adjusts the sampling interval based on preset conditions. When the monitoring indicators are normal, telemetry reduces the sampling interval. When the monitoring indicators reach the threshold, telemetry automatically adjusts the sampling interval based on the configuration to report collected data at a higher frequency, reducing the amount of data on the analyzer.\nThe sensor-group sample-adaptive command associates a sampling sensor group with a subscription and displays the sample-adaptive view."
