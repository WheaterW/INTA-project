    "ExtraInfo": "In normal situations, the router can correctly receive ICMP packets. In the case of heavy network traffic, if hosts or ports are frequently unreachable, the router receives a large number of ICMP packets, which causes heavier traffic burden and performance deterioration. In addition, network attackers often make use of ICMP error packets to probe the internal network structure.\nTo improve device performance and enhance network security, run the icmp rate-limit threshold command to set the ICMP packet rate limit.\nAfter the icmp rate-limit threshold command is run, when the rate at which ICMP messages are sent over a specified interface exceeds the limit, an ACL is automatically delivered to allow the device to discard ICMP messages destined for the local device and start the ICMP packet rate limit timer."
