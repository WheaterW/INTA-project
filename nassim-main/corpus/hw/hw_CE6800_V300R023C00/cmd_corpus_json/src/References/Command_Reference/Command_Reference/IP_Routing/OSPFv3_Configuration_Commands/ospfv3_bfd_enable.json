    "ExtraInfo": "A link fault or topology change on a network causes route recalculation in an area. Shortening the convergence time of routing protocols is important to improve network performance.\nLink faults cannot be completely avoided. Therefore, it is feasible to speed up fault detection and quickly notify routing protocols of faults. BFD is associated with routing protocols. Once a link fails, BFD can speed up the convergence of routing protocols.\nWhen BFD detects a link fault on the network, the interface is disconnected because BFD goes Down even if the fault is rectified quickly. As a result, the link is unstable and traffic is lost. To ensure network reliability and solve the preceding problems, run the ospfv3 bfd incr-cost command on an OSPFv3 interface to adjust the link cost. When the OSPFv3 interface detects that a BFD session goes Down, the OSPFv3 interface automatically increases the link cost.\nWhen the device detects that the BFD session goes Up, the cost of the interface is automatically restored to the previous cost. If frequent BFD status changes occur due to bad link quality, traffic loss may occur due to link instability. To address this problem, run the ospfv3 bfd incr-cost wtr command to set a withdrawal delay on an OSPFv3 interface. BFD status changes within the delay do not cause path calculation changes, ensuring network reliability."
