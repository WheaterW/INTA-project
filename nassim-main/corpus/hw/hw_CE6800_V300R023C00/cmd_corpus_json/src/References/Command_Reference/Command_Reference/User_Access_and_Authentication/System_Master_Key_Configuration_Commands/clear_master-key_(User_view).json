To provide secure data transmission and storage on the network, ensure that keys are under complete control of the specific tenant and cannot be obtained by network providers or other tenants. To be specific, tenants need to have their own key management schemes. Tenants can manually clear historical system master keys based on actual requirements to enhance data security and reliability."
