    "ExtraInfo": "The lifetime of a digital certificate is limited. A Certificate Authority (CA) can revoke a digital certificate to shorten the lifetime of the digital certificate. A CRL is a list of certificates that have been revoked, and therefore should not be relied upon. The CRL is issued by a CA. If a CA revokes a certificate, the key pair defined in the certificate can no longer be used even if the certificate does not expire. After a certificate in a CRL expires, the certificate is deleted from the CRL to shorten the CRL.\nIf the key carried in a certificate is disclosed or a certificate needs to be revoked, use a third-party tool to revoke the certificate. The certificate will be marked revoked and added to a CRL."
