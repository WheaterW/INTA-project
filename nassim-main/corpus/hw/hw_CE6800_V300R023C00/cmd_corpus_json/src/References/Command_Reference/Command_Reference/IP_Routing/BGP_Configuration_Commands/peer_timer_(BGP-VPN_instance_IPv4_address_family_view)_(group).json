    "ExtraInfo": "After establishing a BGP connection, two peers periodically send Keepalive messages to each other to detect the status of the BGP connection. If a device receives no Keepalive message or any other type of message from its peer within the specified hold time, the device considers the BGP connection interrupted and closes the BGP connection.\nThe keepalive-time and hold-time values are determined through negotiation between peers. The smaller value of hold-time contained in Open messages of both peers is used as the final value of hold-time. The smaller value of one third of hold-time and the locally configured keepalive-time is used as the final value of keepalive-time.\nYou can run this command to set the Keepalive time and hold time of BGP."
