    "ExtraInfo": "When an IS-IS network is connected to other ASs, IS-IS must be enabled on the interfaces that connect the IS-IS network to other ASs so that the devices on the IS-IS network can learn the routes to other ASs. The interfaces, however, unnecessarily advertise IS-IS Hello packets on their network segments. In this situation, you can run the isis silent command to suppress the interfaces."
