    "ExtraInfo": "This function is used on the DHCP relay agent. Option 82 records the location of a DHCP client. A device adds Option 82 to a DHCP request message to send the location of a DHCP client to the DHCP server. This enables the DHCP server to allocate a proper IP address and other configurations to the client based on the content of Option 82, implementing security control on the client. The administrator can run this command to configure the device to insert one or more of the circuit-id suboption, remote-id suboption, subscriber-id suboption and vendor-specific suboption in the Sub9 field into the DHCP Option 82 field. After the command is executed, if the format of the sub-option to be inserted is not configured, the sub-option is not inserted by default.\nThe configuration in the interface view takes precedence over that in the VLAN view. The configuration in the VLAN view takes precedence over that in the BD view. The configuration in the BD view takes precedence over that in the system view. If the default configuration is used in all views, the configuration in the system view takes effect."
