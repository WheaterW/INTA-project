This command enables users to enter commands through this interface to query device information and configure the device.\nTo configure or maintain the parameters of a user interface through a channel as a network administrator, the undo shell command can be used to disable terminal services on the user interface. Then, other users are not allowed to log in to the device through this channel. After configuring parameters for the user interface, run the shell command to enable terminal services for the user interface. Otherwise, authorized users cannot log in to the device through this channel. After the undo shell command is configured in the VTY view, the user interface does not provide access services such as STelnet."
