    "ExtraInfo": "This command applies to DHCP relay agents. In some situations, for example, a user is logged out, the user's IP address is no longer used. However, the user cannot access the network, and will not send a DHCP release message to the DHCP server to release the IP address assigned by the DHCP server. Before the IP address lease expires, the DHCP server will not assign the user's IP address to another client, wasting IP addresses. In this case, you can run the dhcp relay release command to configure a DHCP relay agent to send a DHCP release message to the DHCP server. After receiving the message, the DHCP server sets the status of the IP address to idle. The DHCP server then can assign the released IP address to another client.\nIf a DHCP server address is specified, the DHCP relay agent sends an address release request only to the specified DHCP server. If no DHCP server address is specified, the following situations occur:"
