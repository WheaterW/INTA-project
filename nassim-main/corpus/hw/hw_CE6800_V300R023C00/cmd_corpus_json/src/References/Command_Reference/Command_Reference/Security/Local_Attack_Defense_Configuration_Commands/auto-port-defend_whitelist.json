    "ExtraInfo": "The port attack defense function is enabled by default on the device, so the device calculates protocol packet rates on all interfaces, and traces the source and limits the rate of attack packets. In some services, network-side interfaces need to receive a lot of valid protocol packets. You should add these interfaces or network nodes connecting to these interfaces to the whitelist. The device does not trace the source or limit the rate of protocol packets received by the interfaces in the whitelist. In this manner, the CPU can promptly process the packets from the network-side interfaces."
