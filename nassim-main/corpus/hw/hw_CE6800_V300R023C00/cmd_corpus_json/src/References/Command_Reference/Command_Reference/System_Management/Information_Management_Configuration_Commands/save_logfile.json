    "ExtraInfo": "The system records what happens to a device during device operations as logs. To reduce the times of writing the storage, the device caches logs in memory before writing them into information files. The device immediately writes logs cached in the memory into information files when the log buffer is full or a timer expires.\nIf the log buffer is not full or the timer does not expire, run the save logfile command to manually write logs in the memory into information files."
