    "ExtraInfo": "An ATT bit is a field in LSPs. An ATT bit identifies whether a Level-1 area is attached to other areas. A Level-1-2 router sets the ATT bit to 1 to notify the routers in the Level-1 area of its attachment to a Level-2 backbone area. After a Level-1 router receives the LSPs carrying the ATT bit 1 from the Level-1-2 router, the Level-1 router generates a route with the same destination address as the default route of the Level-1-2 router. Traffic can be forwarded along this route.\nTo prevent the Level-1 router from advertising the default route when the ATT bit is set to 1, run the attached-bit avoid-learning command.\nTo prevent the Level-1 router from advertising default routes to the routing table, use either of the following methods:"
