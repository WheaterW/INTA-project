Besides assigning IP addresses, a DHCP server can also provide the required network configuration parameters, such as the startup configuration file name for the DHCP clients. After the startup configuration file name is configured using the bootfile command, the Offer and ACK packets sent from the DHCP server carry this file name. The DHCP client can acquire the startup configuration file from the specified server based on the file name."
