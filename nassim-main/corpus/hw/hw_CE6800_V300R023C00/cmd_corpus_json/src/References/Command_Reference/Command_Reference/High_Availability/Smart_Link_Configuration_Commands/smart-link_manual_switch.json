    "ExtraInfo": "When the active link in a Smart Link group fails, traffic is automatically switched to the standby link. After the original active link recovers, it remains in the blocked state and does not preempt the active link to ensure stable traffic transmission. Generally, a more stable link needs to be used as the active link. Therefore, after the original active link recovers, you can use either of the following methods to restore the original active link:\nRun the restore enable command to enable the revertive switching function of the Smart Link group. After the revertive switching timer expires, the Smart Link group automatically switches to the active link. You can run the timer wtr command to set the WTR time of a Smart Link group.\nRun the smart-link manual switch command to complete the switchover between the active and standby links in the Smart Link group immediately."
