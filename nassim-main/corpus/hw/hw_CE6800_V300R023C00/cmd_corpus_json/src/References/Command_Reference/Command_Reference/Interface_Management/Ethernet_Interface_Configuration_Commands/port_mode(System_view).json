    "ExtraInfo": "The forty-eight 25GE interfaces on the CE6885, CE6885-T, CE6885-LL, CE6885-SAN, CE6863E-48S8CQ, CE6866, CE6860-HAM, CE6866K or CE6860-SAN are divided into six interface groups based on the interface numbers: interfaces 1 to 8, interfaces 9 to 16, interfaces 17 to 24, interfaces 25 to 32, interfaces 33 to 40, and interfaces 41 to 48. By default, these 25GE interfaces work at the rate of 25 Gbit/s. To configure the 25GE interfaces to work at the rate of 50 Gbit/s, run the port mode 50ge command. If the rate of an interface is switched from 25 Gbit/s to 50 Gbit/s and then a 25GE optical module is installed on the interface, the interface is backward compatible with the rate of 25 Gbit/s.\nThe eight 100GE interfaces on the CE6885, CE6885-T, CE6885-LL, CE6855-48XS8CQ, CE6885-SAN, CE6863E-48S8CQ are divided into four interface groups based on the interface numbers: interfaces 1 and 2, interfaces 3 and 4, interfaces 5 and 6, and interfaces 7 and 8. By default, these 100GE interfaces work at the rate of 100 Gbit/s. To configure the 100GE interfaces to work at the rate of 200 Gbit/s, run the port mode 200ge command. If the rate of an interface is switched from 100 Gbit/s to 200 Gbit/s and then a 40GE optical module is installed on the interface, the interface is backward compatible with the rate of 40 Gbit/s. If the rate of an interface is switched from 100 Gbit/s to 200 Gbit/s and then a 100GE optical module is installed on the interface, the interface is backward compatible with the rate of 100 Gbit/s.\nThe eight 100GE interfaces on the CE6866, CE6860-HAM, CE6866K, CE6860-SAN are divided into two interface groups based on the interface numbers: interfaces 1 to 4 and interfaces 5 to 8. By default, these 100GE interfaces work at the rate of 100 Gbit/s. To configure the 100GE interfaces to work at the rate of 200 Gbit/s, run the port mode 200ge command. If the rate of an interface is switched from 100 Gbit/s to 200 Gbit/s and then a 40GE optical module is installed on the interface, the interface is backward compatible with the rate of 40 Gbit/s. If the rate of an interface is switched from 100 Gbit/s to 200 Gbit/s and then a 100GE optical module is installed on the interface, the interface is backward compatible with the rate of 100 Gbit/s.\nThe eight 100GE interfaces on the CE8851-32CQ8DQ-P, CE8850-HAM, CE8851K or CE8850-SAN are divided into sixteen interface groups based on the interface numbers: interfaces 1 to 2, interfaces 3 to 4, interfaces 5 to 6, interfaces 7 to 8, interfaces 9 to 10, interfaces 11 to 12, interfaces 13 to 14, interfaces 15 to 16, interfaces 17 to 18, interfaces 19 to 20, interfaces 21 to 22, interfaces 23 to 24, interfaces 25 to 26, interfaces 27 to 28, interfaces 29 to 30, and interfaces 31 to 32. By default, these 100GE interfaces work at the rate of 100 Gbit/s. To configure the 100GE interfaces to work at the rate of 200 Gbit/s, run the port mode 200ge command. If the rate of an interface is switched from 100 Gbit/s to 200 Gbit/s and then a 40GE optical module is installed on the interface, the interface is backward compatible with the rate of 40 Gbit/s. If the rate of an interface is switched from 100 Gbit/s to 200 Gbit/s and then a 100GE optical module is installed on the interface, the interface is backward compatible with the rate of 100 Gbit/s.\nThe last four 100GE interfaces on the CE8855, CE8851-32CQ4BQ are divided into two interface groups: one containing interfaces 33 and 34, and the other containing interfaces 35 and 36. By default, these 100GE interfaces work at the rate of 100 Gbit/s. To configure the 100GE interfaces to work at the rate of 200 Gbit/s, run the port mode 200ge command. If the rate of an interface is switched from 100 Gbit/s to 200 Gbit/s and then a 40GE optical module is installed on the interface, the interface is backward compatible with the rate of 40 Gbit/s. If the rate of an interface is switched from 100 Gbit/s to 200 Gbit/s and then a 100GE optical module is installed on the interface, the interface is backward compatible with the rate of 100 Gbit/s.\nIf the rate of any interface in an interface group is switched, all other interfaces in the interface group automatically work at the target rate. If the to keyword is used in the command to specify an interface range, the target rate applies to all interfaces in the range."
