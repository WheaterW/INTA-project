    "ExtraInfo": "The filter-policy export command affects the routes advertised by BGP. After the filter-policy export command is run, BGP filters the routes imported using the import-route command before importing them. Only the routes that pass the filtering can be added to the local BGP routing table and advertised by BGP.\nThe filter-policy import command can be used to filter the routes received by a BGP device globally and determine whether to add the routes to the BGP routing table.\nIf a protocol is specified, only the routes imported from the specified protocol are filtered. The routes imported from other protocols are not affected. If protocol is not specified, the routes imported from all protocols will be filtered.\nWhen configured filtering conditions are used for a named ACL, only the configurations specified by source and time-range take effect."
