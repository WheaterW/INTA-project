If a test instance needs to be performed periodically during the interval between the start time and end time, run the frequency command to set the interval at which the NQA test instance is performed automatically.\nIf no end time is set, the test will not stop automatically. You need to stop it manually.\nFor example, if the start daily 12:00:00 to 13:00:00 begin 2009/10/19 end 2010/10/20 command is run to configure an ICMP test instance to run once between 12:00 to 13:00 each day, and the\nfrequency 1200 command is run to set the interval to 1200 seconds, the start time of the ICMP test instance can be:"
