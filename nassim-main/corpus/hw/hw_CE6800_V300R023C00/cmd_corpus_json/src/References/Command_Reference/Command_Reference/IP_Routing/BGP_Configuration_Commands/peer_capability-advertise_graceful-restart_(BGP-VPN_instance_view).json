    "ExtraInfo": "If the graceful-restart command is run in the BGP view to enable GR globally on a device, all the device's peer relationships are disconnected, and the device has to renegotiate the GR capability with its peers. You are therefore advised to run the peer capability-advertise graceful-restart command instead to enable GR for a specified peer. If GR is not enabled globally, you can run this command to enable the GR capability and configure the device to notify the specified peer of the GR capability. In this manner, the routes and forwarding entries related to the specified peer are not deleted within the GR time, preventing traffic interruption."
