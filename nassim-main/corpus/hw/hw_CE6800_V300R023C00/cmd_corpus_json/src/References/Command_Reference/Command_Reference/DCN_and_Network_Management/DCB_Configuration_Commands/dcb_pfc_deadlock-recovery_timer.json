    "ExtraInfo": "A PFC deadlock may occur on a ring network. You can run the dcb pfc deadlock-recovery timer command to configure the recovery period for hardware-based deadlock detection. During PFC deadlock recovery, PFC frames received by the interface are ignored. The internal scheduler resumes traffic sending or discards traffic in the specified priority queue. After the recovery period expires, the normal flow control mechanism of PFC resumes. If the system still determines that a deadlock occurs in the next deadlock detection period, the deadlock recovery process starts again."
