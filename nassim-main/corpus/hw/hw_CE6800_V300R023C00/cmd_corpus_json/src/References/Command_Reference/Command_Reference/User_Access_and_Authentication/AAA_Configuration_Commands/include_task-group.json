    "ExtraInfo": "If the tasks and permissions of the current task group do not meet user requirements and the required tasks and permissions have been configured in another task group, you can merge the tasks and permissions of the other task group into the current task group to complete the configuration of the current task group. This command simplifies the configuration process and improves configuration efficiency.\nAfter you modify the authority information of the combined task group, the authority information of the current task group is also modified. A maximum of one task group can be combined into one task group. To change the combination relationship, run the undo include task-group command to delete the existing configuration first."
