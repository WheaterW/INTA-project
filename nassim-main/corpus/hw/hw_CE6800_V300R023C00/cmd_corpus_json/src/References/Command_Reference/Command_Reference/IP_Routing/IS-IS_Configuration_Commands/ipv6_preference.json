If different protocols have routes to the same destination, the route with the highest priority is selected for IP packet forwarding.\nYou can set a priority only for specific routes matching a route-policy. For the route that matches the route-policy, the priority set in the route-policy is preferred to the priority set using the ipv6 preference command. If no priority is set in the route-policy or the ipv6 preference command is not run, the default priority is used."
