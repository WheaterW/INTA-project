    "ExtraInfo": "A data center network is dominated by delay-sensitive mice flows, with many typical services made up of mice flows only. Differentiated flow scheduling can prevent mice flows from being hindered by elephant flows. However, it is largely ineffective when only mice flows exist, and also fails to address the packet loss problem caused by burst traffic and incast traffic.\nThe most effective solution to this packet loss problem is to increase the queue buffer to absorb traffic. TCP FlexBuffer can dynamically adjust the buffer for mice- and elephant-flow queues to improve performance."
