    "ExtraInfo": "To enable DHCP clients to obtain IP addresses from authorized DHCP servers, the DHCP snooping security mechanism allows you to configure trusted and untrusted interfaces. The trusted interface forwards DHCP messages, and untrusted interfaces discard DHCP ACK and DHCP Offer messages returned from DHCP servers. The interface directly or indirectly connected to the DHCP server trusted by the administrator needs to be configured as the trusted interface, and other interfaces are configured as untrusted interfaces. This ensures that DHCP clients can obtain IP addresses only from authorized DHCP servers and prevents bogus DHCP servers from assigning IP addresses to DHCP clients. DHCPv6 packets are processed in the same way as in this scenario."
