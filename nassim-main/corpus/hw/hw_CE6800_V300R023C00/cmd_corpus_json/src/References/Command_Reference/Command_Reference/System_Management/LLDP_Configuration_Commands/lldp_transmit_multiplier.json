    "ExtraInfo": "A time multiplier can be set for a device to calculate the valid time of LLDP packets being sent to neighbors. The time of device information held in neighbors can be adjusted by setting this parameter. The formula for calculating the TTL of device information held on neighbors is as follows:\nTTL = Min (65535, (interval x hold-multiplier)). The interval value is configured using the lldp transmit interval command.\nAfter receiving LLDP packets sent by a local device, neighbors update the aging time of local device information based on the TTL value. Even if the local device has LLDP disabled, neighbors still hold local device information until the TTL expires. This effectively prevents frequent network topology changes."
