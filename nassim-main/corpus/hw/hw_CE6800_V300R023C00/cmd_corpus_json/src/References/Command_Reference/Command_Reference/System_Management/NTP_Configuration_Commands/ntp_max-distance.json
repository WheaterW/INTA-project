    "ExtraInfo": "The ntp max-distance command is used on the client side for NTP to calculate the synchronization distance to each NTP server. After the calculation is complete, NTP compares the synchronization distance with the maximum synchronization distance threshold. If the synchronization distance exceeds the threshold, the client will not consider the associated server for clock synchronization."
