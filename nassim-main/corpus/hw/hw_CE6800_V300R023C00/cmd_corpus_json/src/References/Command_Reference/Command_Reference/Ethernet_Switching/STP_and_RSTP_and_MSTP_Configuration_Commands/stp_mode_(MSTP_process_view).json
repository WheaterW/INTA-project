    "ExtraInfo": "After an MSTP process is created on an MSTP network, all ports bound to the MSTP process operate in MSTP mode by default. These ports may be connected to STP/RSTP devices, and spanning trees cannot be properly calculated because devices running different spanning tree protocols cannot exchange packets.To address this problem, run the stp mode command to set an operation mode for a device. The operation mode can be MSTP, RSTP, or STP.By default, if a port bound to an MSTP process is connected to an STP device, the operation mode of this port is automatically switched to STP and the operation mode of the other ports remains MSTP."
