    "ExtraInfo": "On a network running STP, if a port is configured as an edge port using the stp edged-port enable command, the port will not participate in the spanning tree calculation. This speeds up network convergence and improves network stability. However, this port may send BPDUs to other networks, causing network flapping.\nTo prevent this problem, run the stp bpdu-filter enable command on the edge port. The port becomes a BPDU-filter port and will not process BPDUs.\nRunning the stp bpdu-filter enable command in the interface view configures only the current port as a BPDU-filter port. If multiple BPDU-filter ports are required on a device, run the stp bpdu-filter default command in the system view to configure all edge ports as BPDU-filter ports."
