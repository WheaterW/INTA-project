A maximum of five filter criteria can be configured for a path.The filtering field must be of the key type in a node.The filtering field is added at the interface level instead of the last level of the sampling path.\nTelemetry also supports fuzzy match for an interface name in a sampling path. An interface name must end with an asterisk (*) and contain only one asterisk (*). For example:\nGigabitEthernet1/0/*: indicates all interfaces with the prefix of GigabitEthernet1/0/.GigabitEthernet1/*: indicates all interfaces with the prefix of GigabitEthernet1/.GigabitEthernet*: indicates all interfaces with the prefix of GigabitEthernet.GigabitEt*: indicates all interfaces with the prefix of GigabitEt.*: indicates all device interfaces supported by the service corresponding to the sampling path.\nThe preceding interface types are for reference only. For details, see the interface types supported by the device.\nThe value is a string of 1 to 511 case-sensitive characters."
