    "ExtraInfo": "An IP header contains a Don't Fragment (DF) field, indicating whether an IP packet can be fragmented. If the DF field of an IP packet is set to 1, a device does not fragment the packet. If the size of an IP packet is greater than the MTU of an interface because of a protocol encapsulation, a device discards the packet and sends ICMP error messages, causing data loss. To prevent data loss in this scenario, run the clear ip df command to enable the forced fragmentation of IP packets."
