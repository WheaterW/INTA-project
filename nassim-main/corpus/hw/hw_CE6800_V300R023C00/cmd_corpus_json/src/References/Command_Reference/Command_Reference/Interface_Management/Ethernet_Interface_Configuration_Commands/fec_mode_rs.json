    "ExtraInfo": "RS-FEC is a bit error correction technology that adds correction information to data packets at the transmit end, and corrects bit errors generated during data packet transmission at the receive end based on the correction information. RS-FEC improves the signal quality, but increases the signal transmission delay. You can disable this function based on requirements to reduce the signal transmission delay.\nYou can run the display interface command in any view or the display this interface command in the interface view to check whether the FEC function is enabled on an interface based on the Fec field in the command output."
