    "ExtraInfo": "A PFC deadlock may occur on a ring network. You can run the priority deadlock-detect time command to configure the detection interval for hardware-based deadlock detection. During the detection period, the system checks the PFC frames received by the queue. If the queue is in the flow-controlled state throughout the detection period, the system considers that a PFC deadlock occurs. In this case, the PFC deadlock recovery process needs to be performed.\nDuring PFC deadlock recovery, PFC frames received by the interface are ignored. The internal scheduler resumes traffic sending or discards traffic in the specified priority queue. After the recovery period expires, the normal flow control mechanism of PFC resumes. If the system still determines that a deadlock occurs in the next deadlock detection period, the deadlock recovery process starts again."
