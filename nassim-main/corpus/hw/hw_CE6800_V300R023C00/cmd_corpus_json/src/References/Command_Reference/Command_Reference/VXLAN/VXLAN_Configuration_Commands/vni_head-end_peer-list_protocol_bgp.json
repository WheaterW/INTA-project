    "ExtraInfo": "After the ingress of a VXLAN tunnel receives broadcast, unknown unicast, and multicast (BUM) packets, it replicates these packets and sends a copy to each VTEP in the ingress replication list. The ingress replication list is a collection of remote VTEP IP addresses to which the ingress of a VXLAN tunnel should send replicated BUM packets.\nIf a source VTEP on a VXLAN connects to multiple remote VTEPs on the same VXLAN segment, run the vni head-end peer-list command to configure an ingress replication list that contains the IP addresses of those remote VTEPs. After the source NVE receives BUM packets, the local VTEP sends a copy of the BUM packets to every VTEP in the list. To use BGP to dynamically establish Layer 2 VXLAN tunnels, run the vni head-end peer-list protocol bgp command."
