    "ExtraInfo": "When MACsec is used to encrypt and decrypt data packets, the interface on the local device and that on the remote device must use the same security key to establish an MKA session. The key is generated and distributed by the key server. Therefore, you need to configure the key server priority on the interfaces of both devices. A smaller value indicates a higher priority. The device with a higher priority is elected as the key server.\nIf the two interfaces have the same key server priority, the device with a smaller SCI value is elected as the key server. An SCI consists of the MAC address of an interface and the last two bytes of the interface index."
