    "ExtraInfo": "In the NFVI distributed gateway scenario, if the local VXLAN tunnel or Layer 2 sub-interface functioning as the gateway to receive ARP request packets goes Down, ARP entries cannot be generated, and packets are discarded. In this case, run the arp broadcast-detect enable command to enable ARP broadcast probe in the VBDIF interface view. Because ARP request packets are broadcast, they can be broadcast in a BD. When the local VXLAN tunnel or Layer 2 sub-interface is Down, ARP request packets cannot be sent locally. However, if the remote VXLAN tunnel or Layer 2 sub-interface is Up, ARP requests can be sent, and dynamic ARP entries can be learned upon receipt of ARP response packets. The remote device can then synchronize learned ARP entries to the local device through EVPN routes, and redirected ARP entries are generated on the local device.\nTo set the maximum allowable number of ARP broadcast probes implemented when a VXLAN tunnel or Layer 2 sub-interface goes Down, run the arp broadcast-detect times command."
