    "ExtraInfo": "In a test, each time a packet is sent for a test, it is called a probe. The difference between this command and the probe-failtimes command is that the probe-failtimes command is used to configure the number of consecutive probe failures, that is, the number of consecutive packet sending failures. This command is used to set the number of consecutive test failures. Multiple packets may be sent in a test, that is, a test may contain multiple probes.\nBy default, a test is considered as a success if one or more probes in the test succeed; a test is considered failed if all probes in the test fail.\nAfter the test-failtimes command is run for an NQA test instance, traps will be sent only when send-trap is enabled."
