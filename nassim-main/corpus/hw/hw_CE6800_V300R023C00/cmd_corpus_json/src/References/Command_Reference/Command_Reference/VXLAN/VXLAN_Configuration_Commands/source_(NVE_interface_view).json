    "ExtraInfo": "A VTEP is a VXLAN tunnel endpoint that encapsulates or decapsulates VXLAN packets. It is represented by a network virtualization edge (NVE).\nTo configure an IP address for a source VTEP, run the source command. In VXLAN packets, the source IP address is the source VTEP's IP address, and the destination IP address is a remote VTEP's IP address. This pair of VTEP addresses corresponds to a VXLAN tunnel."
