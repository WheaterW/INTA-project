The vrrp6 vrid preempt timer delay command sets a preemption delay for a router in a Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol for IPv6 (VRRP6) group. The undo vrrp6 vrid preempt timer delay command restores the default preemption delay. The default preemption delay is 5 seconds for a preemption caused by an interface up event or 0 seconds (indicating immediate preemption) for a preemption caused by any other reason. This command is supported only on the CE6863H, CE6863H-K, CE6860-SAN, CE6866K, CE6866, CE6860-HAM, CE6855-48XS8CQ, CE6885-SAN, CE8850-SAN, CE8855, CE8851-32CQ4BQ, CE8851K, CE8851-32CQ8DQ-P, CE8850-HAM, CE6881H, CE6881H-K, CE6820H, CE6820H-K, CE6820S, CE6885, CE6885-T, CE6885-LL (standard forwarding mode) and CE6863E-48S8CQ.",

    "ExtraInfo": "On an unstable network, if backup routers in a VRRP6 backup group fail to receive VRRP packets from the master router within a specified timeout period, a backup router with the highest priority preempts the Master state. If network congestion occurs, backup routers also may not receive VRRP packets from the master router. To prevent frequent master/backup VRRP6 switchovers, run the vrrp6 vrid preempt-mode timer delay command to set a preemption delay for a backup router in a VRRP6 backup group. The backup router preempts the Master state only after the configured preemption delay elapses."
