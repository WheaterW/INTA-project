    "ExtraInfo": "In some scenarios on the live network, to achieve network traffic interworking, EBGP full-mesh connections may be required. However, establishing full-mesh connections among Routers that function as ASBRs is costly and places high requirements on the performance of the Routers, which adversely affects the network topology and Router expansion. The route server function is similar to the RR function in IBGP scenarios and allows Routers to advertise routes to their clients (ASBR Routers) without changing route attributes, such as AS_Path, Nexthop, and MED. With the route server function, EBGP full-mesh connections are not required among the ASBR Routers, which reduces network resource consumption."
