    "ExtraInfo": "An update peer-group may contain multiple peers. If the local device advertises routes to one peer slowly due to network congestion, the speed at which the local device advertises routes to other peers in the update peer-group is affected. To prevent this problem, slow peer detection is enabled by default.\nAfter slow peer detection is enabled, the local device calculates the difference between the time taken to send messages to each peer in the update peer-group and the shortest time taken to send messages to each peer in the group. If the difference between the time taken to send messages to a peer and the shortest time is greater than the threshold specified for slow peer detection, the local device considers this peer as a slow peer and removes it from the update peer-group, which prevents this slow peer from affecting route advertisement to other peers in the group."
