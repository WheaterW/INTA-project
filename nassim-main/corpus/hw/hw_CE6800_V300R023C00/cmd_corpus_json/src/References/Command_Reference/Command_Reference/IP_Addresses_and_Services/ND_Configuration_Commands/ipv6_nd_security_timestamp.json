The ipv6 nd security timestamp command sets timestamp parameters for an ND message. The undo ipv6 nd security timestamp command restores default timestamp parameters of an ND message. By default, the maximum difference between the receive time and send time of an ND message is 300 seconds; the maximum difference between the system time of the sender and the system time of the receiver is 1%; the maximum alive time of an ND message is 1 second.

    "ExtraInfo": "If an ND message sent to an interface is intercepted by an attacker, the ND message will be delayed to reach the interface. Therefore, to limit the difference between the time when the local end receives an ND message and the time when the peer end sends an ND message, you can run this command to set timestamp parameters. The system calculates the time range based on these parameters. If the difference between the time when the packet is received and the time when the packet is sent exceeds the time range that the interface can receive, the packet is considered invalid and discarded."
