    "ExtraInfo": "The dhcp select global command applies to DHCP servers. After receiving a DHCP Request message from a DHCP client, a DHCP server assigns an IP address from the local address pool to the client. Run the dhcp select global command to configure the device to assign IP addresses from the global address pool. When no interface address pool is created for the DHCP server, the DHCP server assigns an IP address from the global address pool to an online user."
