    "ExtraInfo": "You can run this command to enable the local port forwarding service for the SSH server to allow the SSH server to establish TCP connections that cannot be established before due to limitations imposed by a firewall. The SSH server can receive forwarding request messages from the SSH client and establish a TCP connection (forwarding channel) with a host with a specified IP address and port number to forward data received from the client to the host only after the local port forwarding function is enabled on the SSH server."
