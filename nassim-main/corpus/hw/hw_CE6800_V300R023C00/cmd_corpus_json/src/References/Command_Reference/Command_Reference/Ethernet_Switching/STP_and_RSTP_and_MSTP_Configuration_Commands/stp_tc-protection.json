    "ExtraInfo": "On a Layer 2 network running STP, a device that receives TC BPDUs will delete its MAC and ARP entries. Frequent deletion operations lead to high CPU usage. In this case, run the stp tc-protection command to enable the TC BPDU protection function.\nAfter the TC BPDU protection function is enabled using the stp tc-protection command, you can run the stp tc-protection interval command to set the time for a device to process the maximum number of TC BPDUs specified by the stp tc-protection threshold command. If the number of received TC BPDUs exceeds the maximum number, the device processes the excess TC BPDUs after the time specified by the stp tc-protection interval command expires. For example, if the time is set to 10 seconds and the maximum number is set to 5, when a device receives TC BPDUs, the device processes only the first 5 TC BPDUs within 10 seconds and processes the other TC BPDUs after the time expires. In this way, the device does not frequently update its MAC and ARP entries, reducing CPU usage."
