    "ExtraInfo": "In a scenario where two devices are interconnected and fault detection is enabled, the remote interface is Up, but the status of the local interface alternates between Up and Down multiple times due to link signal jitter and the hwLocalFaultAlarm alarm is reported, affecting services. In this case, you are advised to run this command to disable the fault detection function on the interface. This ensures that the local interface does not go Down due to link signal jitter or other causes, ensuring service continuity."
