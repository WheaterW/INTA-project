    "ExtraInfo": "If LLDP is enabled on an interface, the interface can exchange LLDP packets with neighboring nodes, learning neighbor status information while sending local status information to neighbors. By collecting status information stored on each network device, the NMS can discover the overall network topology. If LLDP alternates between Up and Down on device interfaces, the network will flap frequently.\nTo set the delay for initializing LLDP on interfaces, run the lldp restart-delay command. This command helps prevent network flapping caused by frequent LLDP status changes on interfaces."
