    "ExtraInfo": "When BGP initiates a TCP connection, the ConnectRetry timer is stopped if the TCP connection is established successfully. If the attempt to establish a TCP connection fails, BGP tries again to establish the TCP connection after the ConnectRetry timer expires. The ConnectRetry interval can be adjusted as needed."
