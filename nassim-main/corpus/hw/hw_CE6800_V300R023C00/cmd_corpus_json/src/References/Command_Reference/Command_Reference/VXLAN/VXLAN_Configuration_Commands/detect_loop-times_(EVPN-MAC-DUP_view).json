    "ExtraInfo": "On an EVPN VXLAN network, two PEs may interconnect through both network-side and access-side links. If this is the case, BUM traffic loops and MAC route flapping both occur, preventing devices from working properly. In this case, MAC duplication suppression on the devices works. By default, the system checks the number of times a MAC address entry flaps within a detection period (180s by default). If the number of times a MAC address entry flaps exceeds the upper threshold (5 by default), the system considers MAC route flapping to be occurring on the network and consequently suppresses the flapping MAC routes. The suppressed MAC routes cannot be sent to a remote PE through a BGP EVPN peer relationship. To modify the detection period or the threshold for MAC address entry flapping, run the detect loop-times command."
