    "ExtraInfo": "Virtual Spanning Tree Protocol (V-STP) is a Layer 2 topology management feature in the M-LAG solution. The core idea of V-STP is to virtualize STP of two devices into STP of one device and present the two devices as one device for STP calculation. The default port ID carried in BPDUs sent by an M-LAG interface is 1. When a device is connected to a downstream network or transparently transmits BPDUs, the BPDUs sent by the M-LAG interface are looped back to the two V-STP devices. As a result, as the system MAC address and port number are the same, the system incorrectly considers that a self-loop occurs on the M-LAG interface and blocks the M-LAG interface. To solve this problem, the port ID extension function is introduced for BPDUs sent by M-LAG interfaces.\nAfter this function is configured, because different M-LAG interfaces send different port IDs, the M-LAG interface with a larger V-STP port ID is blocked after transparent transmission loopback is performed on the peer end. You can run the display stp v-stp command to view the port ID."
