    "ExtraInfo": "After a BGP peer relationship is established, the local device learns all routes from the peer and also advertises its local routes to the peer. If the peer relationship is disconnected, the local device deletes all the routes learned from the peer.\nGenerally, a large number of BGP routes exist, and in this case, a large number of routes change and a large amount of data is processed when the BGP peer relationship is flapping. As a result, a high volume of resources are consumed, causing high CPU usage. To prevent high CPU usage in this case, BGP needs to be enabled to suppress the establishment of the peer relationship if it flaps continuously. Such suppression is implemented for a BGP peer relationship that flaps for more than five times consecutively, and the suppression period increases as the number of flapping times increases. You can run the display bgp peer verbose command to check the remaining time that BGP waits to establish the BGP peer relationship.\nAfter the peer relationship stops flapping for a certain period, suppression on the peer relationship establishment is automatically removed. To immediately remove the suppression, you can run the peer oscillation-dampening disable command. Alternatively, you can run a reset command or another command that can cause the peer relationship to be disconnected and re-established."
