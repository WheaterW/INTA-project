    "ExtraInfo": "The maximum response time is used to control the deadline for user hosts to send Report messages. In practice, the response time on a host is a random value from 0 to the maximum response time. The shorter the response time is, the more quickly the IGMP device obtains multicast member information and the more the bandwidth and Router resources are consumed. To set the maximum response time, run the igmp max-response-time command.\nAfter receiving an IGMP Query message, a user host starts a timer for each group that it joins. The value of the timer ranges from 0 to the maximum response time. When the timer expires, the host sends Report messages.\nThe maximum response time can be used to control the deadline for sending Report messages by the user host. If the maximum response time is properly set, user hosts can rapidly respond to Query messages, and traffic congestion caused by a large number of hosts simultaneously sending response packets is prevented.\nThe function of the igmp max-response-time command is the same as the function of the max-response-time command in the IGMP view. The configuration in the IGMP view is effective for all interfaces, whereas the configuration in the interface view is effective only for the specified interface. The configuration in the interface view takes precedence over the configuration in the IGMP view. The configuration in the IGMP view is used only when the configuration in the interface view is not available."
