    "ExtraInfo": "On a network running spanning tree protocol, if a device does not receive BPDUs from an upstream device within the timeout period, it considers that the upstream device becomes faulty and will recalculate the spanning tree.\nThe upstream device sometimes fails to send BPDUs within the timeout period because it is busy processing services. In this situation, the downstream device should not recalculate the spanning tree. You can run the stp timer-factor command to set a larger time factor to prolong the timeout period. This reduces network resource waste."
