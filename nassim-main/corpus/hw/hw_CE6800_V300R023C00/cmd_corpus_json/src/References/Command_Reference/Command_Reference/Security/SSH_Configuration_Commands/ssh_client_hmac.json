    "ExtraInfo": "To configure HMAC authentication algorithms on an SSH client, run the ssh client hmac command. The SSH client and server negotiate authentication algorithms for the packets exchanged between them. During negotiation, the client sends its authentication algorithms to the server. After comparing the received authentication algorithms with local ones, the server selects the first matching authentication algorithm received for packet transmission. If no matching authentication algorithm is found, the negotiation fails."
