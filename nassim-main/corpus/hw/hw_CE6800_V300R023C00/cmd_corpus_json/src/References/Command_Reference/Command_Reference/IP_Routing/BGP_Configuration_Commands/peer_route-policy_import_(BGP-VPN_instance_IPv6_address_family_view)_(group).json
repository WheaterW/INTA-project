    "ExtraInfo": "After a route-policy is created, the peer route-policy import command is used to apply a Route-Policy to a peer group so that the routes received from a peer group can be controlled. To be specific, only the necessary routes are received from the peer group. In this manner, route management is implemented, the scale of the routing table is reduced, and fewer network resources are consumed."
