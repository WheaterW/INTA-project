    "ExtraInfo": "A root bridge may no longer be the root bridge after receiving Bridge Protocol Data Units (BPDUs) with a higher priority due to incorrect configurations or attacks on the network. Once the network topology is changed, a spanning tree begins to be recalculated, which may cause traffic to be transferred from high-speed links to low-speed links and trigger traffic congestion.\nA designated port enabled with the root protection function cannot change its port role. If such a port receives BPDUs with a higher priority, the port enters the Discarding state and does not forward packets. If the port does not receive any BPDUs with a higher priority before a period (generally twice longer than Forward Delay) expires, the port automatically enters the Forwarding state.\nYou can run the stp timer forward-delay command to set the Forward Delay period."
