    "ExtraInfo": "When configuring proactive NETCONF registration, you can configure an interval at which the device sends NETCONF connection requests firstly to the NMS using the reconnection interval command.The subsequent reconnection interval is exponentially backoff by multiplying two. A maximum of five backoffs are performed. Then, the reconnection interval returns to the initial value and performs cyclic backoff again according to the preceding policy. If the intermediate backoff time is greater than 300s, 300s is used as the retry time to perform this backoff. Then, the system returns to the initial value and performs cyclic backoff again.The formula is as follows: s = t*2^(n \u00e2\u0080\u0093 1), s is the current backoff time, the maximum value of s is 300s, t is the first backoff time, n is the number of reconnections, and the maximum value of n is 5."
