    "ExtraInfo": "If PIM-SM MDT setup does not span MVPN tunnels, a rendezvous point (RP) can be deployed on a PE or CE. If a CE is configured as an RP, the CE needs to establish an MSDP peer relationship with its connected PE and send (S, G) entry information to the PE through MSDP SA messages. To advertise (S, G) entries to the remote PE through BGP Source Active A-D routes, run the import msdp command."
