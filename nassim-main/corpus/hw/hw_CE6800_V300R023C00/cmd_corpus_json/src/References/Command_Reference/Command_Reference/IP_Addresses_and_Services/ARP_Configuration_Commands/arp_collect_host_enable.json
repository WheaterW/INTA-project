    "ExtraInfo": "When tenants access each other for the first time, they send ARP requests. These ARP requests are broadcast on Layer 2 networks and may cause a broadcast storm. To prevent this problem, ARP broadcast suppression can be enabled on Layer 2 VXLAN gateways. However, ARP broadcast suppression replies on the host information table (containing the host IP address, MAC address, VTEP address, and VNI ID) on a Layer 3 gateway.\nTo allow a Layer 3 VXLAN gateway to obtain host information, run the arp collect host enable command in the VBDIF interface view to enable EVN BGP or BGP EVPN to collect host information.\nIn distributed VXLAN gateway (BGP EVPN) scenarios, if VXLAN gateways advertise IRB routes to each other, run the arp collect host enable command for host route advertisement."
