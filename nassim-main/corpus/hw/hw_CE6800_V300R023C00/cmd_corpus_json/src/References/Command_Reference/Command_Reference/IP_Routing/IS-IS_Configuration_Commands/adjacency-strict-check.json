    "ExtraInfo": "During the establishment of IS-IS neighbor relationships, if both IPv4 and IPv6 are configured at both ends, both IPv4 and IPv6 neighbors are established. By default, IPv4 and IPv6 share the standard topology.  If the link between the two ends fails and then recovers, IPv4 goes Up faster than IPv6. When one end receives a message indicating that IPv4 goes Up, it considers that both IPv4 and IPv6 neighbors are restored. If the end sends IPv6 packets to the other end, these IPv6 packets are discarded.\nTo resolve this problem, run the adjacency-strict-check enable command to enable IS-IS adjacency strict-check to ensure that an IS-IS neighbor is established only when both IPv4 and IPv6 go Up."
