    "ExtraInfo": "On a shared network segment where user hosts reside, the querier is responsible for maintaining IGMP group memberships. The robustness variable affects the timeout period of group memberships. The timeout period of a group membership is calculated by using the formula: Timeout period of a group membership = Interval for sending general IGMP query messages x Robustness variable + Maximum response time. The robustness variable defines the following values:"
