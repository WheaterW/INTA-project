    "ExtraInfo": "Attack source tracing samples packets to identify attacks. Errors may occur in attack packet identification or packet rate calculation. A proper packet sampling ratio can reduce errors. A small sampling ratio makes the attack source tracing result accurate, but increases CPU usage. For example, when the sampling ratio is set to 1, every packet is sampled. The attack source tracing result is accurate, but the CPU usage is high because every packet is resolved.\nThe auto-defend attack-packet sample command sets the sampling ratio. You can set a proper value based on the requirements of attack source tracing precision and CPU usage."
