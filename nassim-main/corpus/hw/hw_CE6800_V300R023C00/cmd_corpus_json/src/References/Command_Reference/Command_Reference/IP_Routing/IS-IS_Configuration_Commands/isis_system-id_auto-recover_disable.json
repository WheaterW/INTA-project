    "ExtraInfo": "A system ID uniquely identifies an IS-IS device. If the same system ID is configured for more than one device on the network, a routing loop may occur. By default, IS-IS is enabled to automatically change its system ID in the case of a system ID conflict. When a system ID conflict occurs, IS-IS automatically changes the local system ID to resolve the conflict.\nTo disable the system from automatically resolving IS-IS system ID conflicts, run the isis system-id auto-recover disable command. After the command is run, IS-IS system ID conflicts need to be manually resolved.\nThe first two bytes of the system ID automatically changed by the system are Fs, and the last four bytes are randomly generated."
