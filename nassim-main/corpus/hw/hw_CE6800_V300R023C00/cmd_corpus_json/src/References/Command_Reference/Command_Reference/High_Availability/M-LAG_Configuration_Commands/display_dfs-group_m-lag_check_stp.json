    "ExtraInfo": "When V-STP is configured in M-LAG networking, you can run this command to check whether the STP configurations on both ends in the M-LAG are consistent. If parameters are inconsistent, the calculation results on both ends may be different. As a result, network forwarding fails or network flapping occurs. Determine and modify the configurations to ensure that the STP configurations on both ends are consistent."
