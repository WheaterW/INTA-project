    "ExtraInfo": "After receiving an IGMP Leave message for a multicast group from a host, a device enabled with prompt leave directly deletes the forwarding entry of the multicast group, without sending group-specific query messages. When an interface is connected to only one host, the prompt leave mechanism can be used to shorten the response delay and release bandwidth resources in a timely manner.\nIf group-policy or group-policy acl-name is not set in the igmp snooping prompt-leave command, prompt leave will take effect for all multicast groups.\nIf group-policy or group-policy acl-name is set in this command, the configured ACL will be used to filter Leave messages received in the BD."
