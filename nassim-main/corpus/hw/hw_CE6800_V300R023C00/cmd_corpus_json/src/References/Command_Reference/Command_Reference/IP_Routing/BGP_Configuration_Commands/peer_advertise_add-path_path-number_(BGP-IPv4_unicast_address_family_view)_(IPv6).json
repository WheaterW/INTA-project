To configure the maximum number of routes that the RR can send to a specified BGP peer, run the peer advertise add-path path-number command. The actual number of preferred routes advertised to the peer is the smaller value between the number of routes configured using the peer advertise add-path path-number command and the number of selected routes. If the number of routes that the RR can send to the peer is less than the actual number of routes selected by the RR, the RR selects routes based on the BGP route selection rules."
