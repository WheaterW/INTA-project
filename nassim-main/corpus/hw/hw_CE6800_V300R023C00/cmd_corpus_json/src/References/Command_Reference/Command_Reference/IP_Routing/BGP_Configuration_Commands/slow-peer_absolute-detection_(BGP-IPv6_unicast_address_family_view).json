The slow-peer absolute-detection threshold command configures an absolute threshold for slow peer detection. The undo slow-peer absolute-detection threshold command restores the absolute threshold of slow peer detection. The slow-peer absolute-detection disable command disables slow peer detection in absolute mode. The undo slow-peer absolute-detection disable command enables slow peer detection in absolute mode. By default, slow peer detection in absolute mode is enabled, and the threshold for slow peer detection in absolute mode is 9s.
