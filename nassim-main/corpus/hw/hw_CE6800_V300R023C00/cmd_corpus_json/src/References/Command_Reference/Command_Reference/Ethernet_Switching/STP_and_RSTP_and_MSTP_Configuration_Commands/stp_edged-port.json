    "ExtraInfo": "On a Layer 2 network running STP, if a port connected to a terminal is configured as an edge port using the stp edged-port enable command, the port will not participate in spanning tree calculation. This speeds up network convergence and improves network stability.\nRunning the stp edged-port enable command in the interface view configures only the current port as a bridge protocol data unit (BPDU)-filter port. If multiple BPDU-filter ports are required on a device, run the stp edged-port default command in the system view to configure all the ports as BPDU-filter ports, and then run the stp edged-port disable command in the view of the interfaces that need to participate in spanning tree calculation.\nIf a port has been configured as a non-BPDU filter port using the stp edged-port disable command, it remains a non-BPDU filter port, even if the stp edged-port default command is run."
