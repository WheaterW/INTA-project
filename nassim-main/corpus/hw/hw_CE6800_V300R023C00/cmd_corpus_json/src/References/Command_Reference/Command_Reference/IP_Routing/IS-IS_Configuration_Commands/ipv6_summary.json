    "ExtraInfo": "An IS-IS routing table on a medium or large IS-IS network may contain a large number of routing entries. Storing the routing entries consumes a large number of memory resources, and transmitting and processing such routing information consumes a large number of network resources. IS-IS route summarization can solve this problem.\nRoute summarization allows multiple routes with the same IPv6 prefix to be summarized into one route, which reduces the number of routing entries and system resource consumption. In addition, if a specific link frequently alternates between up and down, the link status changes will not be advertised to devices that are located beyond the summary route network segment, preventing route flapping and improving network stability.\nConfiguring route summarization does not affect the routing table on a local device. Each specific route is displayed in the routing table. Configuring route summarization, however, reduces LSPs to be flooded. Any device that receives the LSP from the summarization-capable router has only one summary route in its routing table."
