    "ExtraInfo": "NQA test instances can detect network operation conditions, output statistics, and effectively cut costs. NQA measures the performance of different protocols on the network, which allows carriers to collect the operation indicator of networks in real time.\nTo query the history statistics on NQA tests, run the display nqa history [ this ] command. You can view information about each test packet, including the status and round trip delay. This allows you to learn about network running status."
