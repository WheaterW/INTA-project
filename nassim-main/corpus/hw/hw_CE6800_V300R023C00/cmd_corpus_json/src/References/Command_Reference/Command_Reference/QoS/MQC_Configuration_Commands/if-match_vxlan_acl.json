    "ExtraInfo": "The if-match vxlan acl command creates a matching rule based on inner information in VXLAN packets in an IPv4 ACL on the VXLAN network. You must first define an IPv4 ACL, configure rules in the IPv4 ACL, and then run the if-match vxlan acl command to configure a matching rule based on the IPv4 ACL. This ensures that the device processes packets matching the traffic classifier in the same way."
