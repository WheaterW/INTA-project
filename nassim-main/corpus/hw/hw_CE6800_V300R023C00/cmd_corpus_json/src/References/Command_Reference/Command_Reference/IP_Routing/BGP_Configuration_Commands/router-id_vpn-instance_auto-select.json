Each router ID identifies a device in an AS.\nYou can run the router-id vpn-instance auto-select command to configure automatic router ID selection for a BGP-VPN instance so that the router ID of the BGP-VPN instance is distinguished from the BGP router ID. If a router ID has been manually specified for a BGP VPN instance, the manually specified router ID takes precedence over the automatically selected router ID. For more information about the router ID of a BGP-VPN instance, see router-id (BGP-VPN instance IPv4 address family view)."
