    "ExtraInfo": "When the device receives the first ARP packet from a user, the device generates an ARP entry for the user. If the information carried in subsequent ARP packets sent by the user changes, the ARP entry is updated. If attackers forge and send ARP packets to update ARP entries of authorized users, the device learns incorrect ARP entries and authorized users cannot use the network normally. To resolve this problem, run the arp anti-attack entry-check enable command to enable fixed ARP. After a device generates an ARP entry for a user, the device either allows specific information in the ARP entry to be updated or prohibits any information to be updated. Fixed ARP can be implemented in the following modes:"
