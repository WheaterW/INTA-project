The arp import host untrust command enables a forwarder to generate ARP entries based on the OpenFlow table delivered by the Agile Controller-DCN (AC-DCN controller). The undo arp import host command disables a forwarder from generating ARP entries based on the OpenFlow table delivered by the AC-DCN controller. By default, a forwarder does not generate ARP entries based on the OpenFlow table delivered by the AC-DCN controller.
