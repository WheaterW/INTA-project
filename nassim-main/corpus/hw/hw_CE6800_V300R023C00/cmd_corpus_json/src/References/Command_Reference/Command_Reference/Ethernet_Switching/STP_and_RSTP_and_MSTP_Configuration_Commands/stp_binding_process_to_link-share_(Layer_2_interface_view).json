    "ExtraInfo": "On a Layer 2 network running MSTP, the link used by multiple access rings is a public link. An interface on the public link participates in the spanning tree calculation for multiple MSTP processes and access rings. Each MSTP process calculates an interface status. As a result, the interface may have multiple status, and which status is used cannot be determined. To prevent this problem, run the stp binding process link-share command to add the interface to multiple MSTP processes. The interface always uses its status in MSTP process 0, although it participates in status calculation in multiple MSTP processes."
