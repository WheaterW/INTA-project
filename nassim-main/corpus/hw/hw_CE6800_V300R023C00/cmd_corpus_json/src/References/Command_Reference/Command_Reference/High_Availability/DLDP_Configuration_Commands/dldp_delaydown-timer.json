    "ExtraInfo": "DLDP in Active, Advertisement, or Probe state may detect a port-Down event. If a TX end of the local port to which a fiber is inserted goes faulty, optical signals on the RX end of the peer port jitter. The peer port status alternates between Up and Down. If a delay time is set, DLDP does not immediately enter Inactive state and remove the peer entry. Instead, it goes to DelayDown state and starts the DelayDown timer. Ports in this state retain DLDP peer information and respond to port-Up events. Running the dldp delaydown-timer command sets the delay time for the DelayDown timer. The delay time determines port status:"
