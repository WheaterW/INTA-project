If the configuration of a forwarder is modified by a non-controller user, the configurations of the controller and forwarder may be inconsistent. The configuration exclusive by-user-name command can be used to specify the controller to lock the system configuration of a forwarder to avoid the inconsistency.\nWhen multiple users manage a device at the same time, you can specify a user to lock the device. Only this user can modify the device configuration, while others cannot."
