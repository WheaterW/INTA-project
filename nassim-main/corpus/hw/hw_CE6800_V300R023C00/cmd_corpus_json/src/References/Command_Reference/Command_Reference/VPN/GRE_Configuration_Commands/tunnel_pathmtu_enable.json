    "ExtraInfo": "If a GRE tunnel is set up between two BGP nodes on which the peer path-mtu auto-discovery command has been run, path MTU auto-discovery can be enabled on the tunnel interface. This prevents TCP packets that contain BGP data from being fragmented multiple times during transmission, improving efficiency of BGP data transmission."
