    "ExtraInfo": "Before configuring a CGA address, you need to run the ipv6 security modifier command to set a modifier value and a security level for the CGA address. A CGA address is calculated by using a specific algorithm based on the public key, modifier value, and security level. The higher the security level, the more secure the generated CGA address.\nAfter a CGA address is configured for an interface, the ND messages sent by the interface are protected against attacks."
