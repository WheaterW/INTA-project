    "ExtraInfo": "After a route is added to the routing table, the route is withdrawn. This process is called route flapping.\nWhen route flapping occurs, a device sends an Update message to its peers. The devices that receive the Update message need to recalculate routes and modify their routing tables. Therefore, frequent route flapping consumes a large number of bandwidth and CPU resources and even affects the normal operation of the network.\nYou can run the reset bgp flap-info command to clear statistics about flapping BGP routes so that the device can recollect statistics about flapping routes. This helps you monitor route changes and locate network problems."
