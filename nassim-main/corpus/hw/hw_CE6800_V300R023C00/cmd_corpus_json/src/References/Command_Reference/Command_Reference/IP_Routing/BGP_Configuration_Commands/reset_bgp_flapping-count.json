    "ExtraInfo": "BGP peer flapping affects the stability of a BGP network and BGP route convergence.\nThe reset bgp flapping-count command can be used to clear the flapping account of a BGP peer. This allows the device to re-collect the flapping statistics of a peer to locate BGP network problems."
