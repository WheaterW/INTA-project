    "ExtraInfo": "When the primary IP address of an interface needs to be deleted, the default configuration affects user services of the secondary IP address. To prevent services of users with secondary IP addresses from being affected, you can enable the device to ignore the primary/secondary status of secondary IP addresses before configuring secondary IP addresses on the device. In this manner, any IP address configured on the interface can be deleted."
