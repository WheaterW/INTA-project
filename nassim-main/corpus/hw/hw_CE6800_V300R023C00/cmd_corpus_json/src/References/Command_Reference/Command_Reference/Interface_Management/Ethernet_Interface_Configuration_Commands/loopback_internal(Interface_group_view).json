    "ExtraInfo": "Before testing some special functions such as locating an Ethernet fault, enable loopback detection on the desired Ethernet interface to check whether the interface is working properly. If no fault occurs on the Ethernet interface, the physical and protocol statuses of the interface are always up after loopback detection is enabled. If a fault occurs, the statuses remain down. After the internal loopback is configured, the test packets sent from the interface are sent back to the interface through the system."
