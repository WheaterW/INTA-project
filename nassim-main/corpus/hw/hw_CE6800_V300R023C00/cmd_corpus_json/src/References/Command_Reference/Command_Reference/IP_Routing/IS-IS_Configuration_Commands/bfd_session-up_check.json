    "ExtraInfo": "When the Layer 2 network is normal, the IS-IS neighbor relationship can be established and routes can be delivered. However, the Layer 3 network is unreachable. As a result, upper-layer traffic is lost. To resolve Layer 3 network faults, run the bfd session-up check command in the IS-IS process view so that the IS-IS neighbor relationship can be established only after a BFD session is established on the corresponding interface. After this function is configured, it applies only to the neighbor relationships to be established (it does not apply to existing neighbor relationships)."
