    "ExtraInfo": "Generally, BGP uses AS numbers to detect routing loops. The local AS number configured using the bgp command and the fake AS number configured using the peer fake-as command are compared with the AS_Path carried in the received route. The number of loops is the largest. After the peer allow-as-loop command is run to set the number of times the local AS number is repeated, the BGP speaker allows the routes with repeated AS numbers in the AS_Path attribute to pass, meeting the requirements of special scenarios."
