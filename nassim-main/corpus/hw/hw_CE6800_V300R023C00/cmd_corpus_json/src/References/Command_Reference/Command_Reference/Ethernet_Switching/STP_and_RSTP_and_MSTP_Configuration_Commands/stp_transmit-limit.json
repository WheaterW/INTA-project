    "ExtraInfo": "On a network running STP, a device sends BPDUs to other devices on the same spanning tree at an interval of the Hello time to maintain network stability. If the device sends too many BPDUs every second, the transmission occupies excessive system and bandwidth resources. To avoid this problem, run the stp transmit-limit command in the system view to configure the maximum number of BPDUs that each interface sends every second. This configuration limits the rate at which each interface sends BPDUs and prevents the spanning tree protocol from occupying excessive system and bandwidth resources.To set the maximum number of BPDUs that each interface on the device sends every second, run the stp transmit-limit command in the system view. To set the maximum number of BPDUs that a specified interface sends every second, run the stp transmit-limit (interface view) command.The Hello time is the value of the Hello timer and specifies the interval at which the device sends BPDUs. You can configure the Hello time using the stp timer hello command."
