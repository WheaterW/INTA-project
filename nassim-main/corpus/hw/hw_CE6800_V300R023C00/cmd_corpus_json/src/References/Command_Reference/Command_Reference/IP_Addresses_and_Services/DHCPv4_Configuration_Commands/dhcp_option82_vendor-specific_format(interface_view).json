    "ExtraInfo": "DHCP users obtain IP addresses from DHCP servers on different subnets through the DHCP relay agent deployed on the gateway. Users on the same subnet have the same gateway address. If the DHCP server uses the gateway address as the destination address of response packets, the response packets cannot be sent to the gateway to which the users belong. As a result, the users fail to go online. In this case, you can run this command on the DHCP relay agent to configure the DHCP relay agent to insert the Sub9 suboption (vendor-specific) into Option 82 and run the dhcp relay information enable command to enable the DHCP relay agent to support Option 82. The DHCP relay agent encapsulates the IP address that uniquely identifies the gateway location into a DHCP Request packet and sends the packet to the DHCP server. The DHCP server that supports Option 82 reserves Option 82 in the response packet. If the response packet is sent back to another gateway, the DHCP relay agent on the gateway forwards the packet to the correct gateway based on the IP address carried in the Sub9 suboption of Option 82."
