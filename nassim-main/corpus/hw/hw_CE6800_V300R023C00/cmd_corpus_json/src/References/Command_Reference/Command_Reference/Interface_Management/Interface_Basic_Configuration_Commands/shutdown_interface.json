To release workloads, run the shutdown interface command to disable sub-interfaces in a batch. After the shutdown interface command is run, the sub-interface operating state changes to Down. If the sub-interface is in the disabled state, run the undo shutdown interface command to start sub-interfaces in a batch, after the undo shutdown interface command is run, the sub-interface operating state is synchronized with the link status."
