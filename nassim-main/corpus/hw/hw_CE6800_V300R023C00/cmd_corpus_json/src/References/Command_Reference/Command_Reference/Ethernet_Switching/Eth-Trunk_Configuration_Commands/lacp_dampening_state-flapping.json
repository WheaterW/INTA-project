    "ExtraInfo": "If the status of an Eth-Trunk interface frequently flaps or the received packets frequently change, the LACP protocol status of the Eth-Trunk interface also flaps, affecting the Eth-Trunk interface operations. To resolve this problem, run the lacp dampening state-flapping command on the Eth-Trunk interface in LACP mode to enable the state flapping suppression function. If flapping occurs three or more times within 1 minute, the suppression level increases by one. If flapping occurs for three or more times within 1 minute after suppression ends, the suppression level continues to increase by one. Otherwise, the suppression level decreases by one. The suppression level ranges from 0 to 5, and the corresponding suppression time is non-suppression, 16s, 32s, 64s, 128s, and 255s, respectively. When the suppression level reaches level 5 and the suppression level increase condition is reached, the suppression level remains unchanged."
