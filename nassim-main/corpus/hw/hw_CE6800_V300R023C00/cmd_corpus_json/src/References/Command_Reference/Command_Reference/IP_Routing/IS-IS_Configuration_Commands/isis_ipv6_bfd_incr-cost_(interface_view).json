    "ExtraInfo": "Either a link fault or topology change on a network will cause routes to be re-calculated within an area. As such, speeding up the convergence of a routing protocol is critical to improving the network performance.\nAs link faults are inevitable, rapidly detecting these faults and notifying routing protocols is an effective way to quickly resolve such issues. This includes associating BFD with a routing protocol to speed up convergence of the routing protocol once a link fault occurs.\nOn a network where BFD detects a link fault, even if the fault is rectified quickly, the involved interface is disconnected due to the fact that the associated BFD session is down. As a result, the link is unstable and traffic is lost. To ensure network reliability and solve the preceding problems, run the isis ipv6 bfd incr-cost command on an IS-IS interface to adjust the link cost. When the IS-IS interface detects that IPv6 BFD goes Down, the IS-IS interface automatically increases the link cost, the link whose IPv6 BFD status is Down is not preferentially selected, and traffic can be transmitted over other links.\nWhen an interface detects that an IPv6 BFD session goes Up, the cost of the interface is automatically restored to the original value. To prevent frequent BFD status changes caused by link quality, traffic loss may occur due to link instability. To solve the preceding problem, you can set the isis ipv6 bfd incr-cost wtr parameter on an IS-IS interface to set a delay in recovering the link cost. If the IPv6 BFD session status changes within the delay, route calculation does not change. This ensures network reliability."
