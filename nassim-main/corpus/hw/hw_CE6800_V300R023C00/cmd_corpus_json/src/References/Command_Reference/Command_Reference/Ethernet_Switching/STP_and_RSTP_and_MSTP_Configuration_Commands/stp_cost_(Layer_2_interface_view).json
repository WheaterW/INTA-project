    "ExtraInfo": "Port path costs are important basis for calculating a spanning tree. Path costs determine root port selection. On a spanning tree, the port with the lowest path cost to the root bridge is selected as a root port. To configure a port path cost, run the stp cost command.\nIf different path costs are set for a port in different spanning tree instances, traffic of different VLANs will be forwarded along different physical links and VLAN-based load balancing can be performed."
