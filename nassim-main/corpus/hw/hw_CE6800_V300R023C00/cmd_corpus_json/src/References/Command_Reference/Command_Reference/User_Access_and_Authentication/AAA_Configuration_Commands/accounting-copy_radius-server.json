    "ExtraInfo": "The existing RADIUS server on the network performs authentication, authorization, and accounting for users. User login and logout information is sent to the server through accounting packets. Users want to deploy an independent RADIUS accounting server (called the level-2 RADIUS accounting server) to obtain user login and logout information for analyzing user behavior and managing users'; access to the network. However, the device currently does not send accounting packets to the level-2 RADIUS accounting server. In this case, you can configure the RADIUS accounting packet copy function on the device. After this function is configured, the device sends user login and logout information to the level-2 RADIUS accounting server through accounting packets for third-party user behavior analysis."
