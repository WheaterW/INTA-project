    "ExtraInfo": "After this command is run, both DHCPv4 snooping and DHCPv6 snooping are disabled.\nIf you run the dhcp snooping enable command to enable DHCP snooping in a VLAN, DHCP snooping is enabled on all interfaces in the VLAN. If you want to disable DHCP snooping on a specified interface, you cannot run the undo dhcp snooping enable command to disable DHCP snooping on the interface because the dhcp snooping enable command is not run on the interface. To solve this problem, run the dhcp snooping disable command to disable DHCP snooping on the interface. Users can then go online from this interface, but no dynamic DHCP binding entry is generated."
