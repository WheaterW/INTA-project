    "ExtraInfo": "On a normal network, a device can correctly send or receive ICMPv6 messages; however, when network traffic load is heavy, host unreachable or port unreachable events frequently occur and ME devices need to send a large number of ICMPv6 messages, which burdens the network and degrades the performance of the ME devices. In addition, attackers usually use ICMPv6 error messages to probe the internal network topology illegitimately.\nTo improve network performance and security, run the ipv6 icmp disable command to disable routing devices from sending or receiving ICMPv6 messages of specified types, such as Echo Reply, Host Unreachable, and Port Unreachable messages. If all-famous or ND-related parameters are specified, exercise caution when running this command. Otherwise, IPv6 unicast services may be affected."
