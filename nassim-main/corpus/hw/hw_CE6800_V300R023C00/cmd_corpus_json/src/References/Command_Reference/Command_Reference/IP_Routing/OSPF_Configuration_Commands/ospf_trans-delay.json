    "ExtraInfo": "The aging time of each LSA in the LSDB increases by one every second, but LSAs do not age during transmission. To configure an LSA transmission delay on a multi-area adjacency interface so that an extension period (the configured delay) is added to the LSAs to be sent, run the ospf trans-delay multi-area command. This configuration is extremely important on low-speed networks."
