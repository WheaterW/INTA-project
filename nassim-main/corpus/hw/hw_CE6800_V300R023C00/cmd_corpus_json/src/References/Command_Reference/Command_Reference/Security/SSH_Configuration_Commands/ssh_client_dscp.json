    "ExtraInfo": "To change the priority of the SSH packets sent by a client, run the ssh client dscp command to change the DSCP value of the packets. A greater DSCP value indicates a higher priority.When you run the undo ssh client dscp command:If value is not specified, the DSCP field is restored to the default value.If value is 48, the DSCP field is restored to the default value.If value is set to a non-48 value, the value must be the same as value in the telnet server dscp command. Otherwise, the command execution fails.The command only takes effect for IPv4 packets."
