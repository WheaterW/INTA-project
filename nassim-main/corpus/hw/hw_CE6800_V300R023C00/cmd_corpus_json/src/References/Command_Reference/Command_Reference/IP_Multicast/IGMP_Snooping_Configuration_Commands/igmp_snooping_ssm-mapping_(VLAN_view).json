    "ExtraInfo": "The SSM mapping mechanism is used to convert IGMPv1 and IGMPv2 Report messages into (S, G) Report messages. This mechanism enables hosts that do not support IGMPv3 to enjoy SSM services. After a mapping between a multicast group G and multicast source addresses such as S1 and S2 is configured on a device, the device checks the group addresses of received IGMPv1 and IGMPv2 messages. If the group addresses are in the SSM group address range, the device converts the messages into an IGMPv3 IS_IN (S1, S2......) messages with the group address being G."
