    "ExtraInfo": "You can increase or decrease the local detection multiplier of a BFD session according to the networking environment.\nIf no BFD packets are received within a detection period, the link that a BFD session detects is regarded as failed, and the BFD session status is set to Down. To reduce the usage of system resources, when detecting that the BFD session is Down, the system adjusts the interval between receiving BFD packets to a random value larger than 1000, in ms. After the BFD session becomes Up, the configured interval is restored.\nThe local detection multiplier of a BFD session determines the detection period on the remote end of the BFD session.\nAsynchronous mode: Detection period = Received Detect Mult of the remote system x Max (Local RMRI, Received DMTI)\nwhere"
