    "ExtraInfo": "CLI and NETCONF are two device management models. To access the CLI-to-XML translation mode, run the xml-translate begin command so that configuration commands can be translated into XML packets in the NETCONF YANG model.\nTo exit the translation mode and enter the user view, run the quit or return command.\nThe xml-translate function is used for the NMS user to obtain packets more conveniently. NETCONF tries to translate packets from the result. The effect of packets may be different from that of commands."
