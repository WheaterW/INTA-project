    "ExtraInfo": "By default, the system performs flapping detection for all MAC addresses. In some scenarios, for example, in a scenario where the flapping of a MAC address is caused by a specific device or operation faults, flapping detection does not need to be implemented for the MAC address, so flapping detection is not needed for this MAC address.\nTo disable the system from implementing flapping detection for a MAC address, run the mac-address flapping detection exclude command to add the MAC address to the MAC flapping detection whitelist. After configuration, if flapping occurs on the specific MAC address, no MAC flapping alarm or record is generated for this MAC address."
