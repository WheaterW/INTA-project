    "ExtraInfo": "You can run the filter-policy import command to set a filtering policy for the received routes. Only the routes that pass the filtering are added to the routing table. The routes that do not pass the filtering are not added to the RIB. OSPF is a link-state dynamic routing protocol, with routing information carried in the link-state database (LSDB). Therefore, the filter-policy import command cannot be used to filter the advertised or received LSAs. Actually, this command is used to filter the routes calculated by OSPF. Only the routes that meet the filtering rules are added to the RIB."
