    "ExtraInfo": "In EVPN VXLAN scenarios, if the remote gateway is configured not to advertise MAC routes (mac-route no-advertise) or is configured not to generate MAC routes (local mac-only-route no-generate), the local gateway cannot generate MAC entries by default. To guide Layer 2 traffic forwarding, run the mac-ip route generate-mac command on the local gateway to enable MAC address entry generation based on MAC/IP routes."
