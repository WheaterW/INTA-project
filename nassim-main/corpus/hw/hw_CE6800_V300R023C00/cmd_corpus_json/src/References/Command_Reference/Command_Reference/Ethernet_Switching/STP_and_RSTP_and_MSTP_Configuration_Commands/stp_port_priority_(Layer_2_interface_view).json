    "ExtraInfo": "When ports participate in spanning tree calculation, the port IDs (PIDs) of these ports on devices may affect the designated port election result. During spanning tree calculation, the port with the smallest PID is elected as the designated port.\nA PID is the ID of a port and consists of a 4-bit priority and a 12-bit port number.\nTo change the priority of a port, run the stp port priority command. This affects the PID of the port and determines whether the port can be elected as the designated port."
