    "ExtraInfo": "By default, the device does not limit the number of access users with the same user name. To limit the number of access users using the same user name, run the access-limit user-name max-num command. For example, in a home Internet access scenario, all home Internet access users share bandwidth. To facilitate maintenance, the server delivers the same user name to replace the user name entered by the user. In this case, the number of users that can access the network must be limited based on the user name to ensure user experience."
