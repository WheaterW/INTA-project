    "ExtraInfo": "Hello messages sent by Routers carry lan-delay and override-interval. lan-delay indicates the delay in transmitting messages in the LAN. When the values of lan-delay on all Routers on the same link are different, the maximum value of these values is used.\nIf a Router receives a Prune message from the upstream interface, it indicates that other downstream Routers still exist in the LAN. If the Router still needs to receive multicast data, it must send a Join message to the upstream interface in the override-interval period.\nWhen receiving a Prune message from a downstream interface, the Router does not perform the prune action immediately until the Prune-Pending Timer (PPT) times out. The PPT equals the value of the lan-delay plus the override-interval. If the Router receives a Join message from the downstream interface in PPT, the Router cancels the prune action."
