    "ExtraInfo": "The lifetime of a digital certificate is limited. A Certificate Authority (CA) can revoke a digital certificate to shorten the lifetime of the digital certificate. A CRL specifies a list of invalid certificates issued by CAs. If a CA revokes a certificate, the declaration about authorized key pairs is revoked before the certificate expires. Once the CRL expires, data listed in the CRL is deleted to shorten the CRL.\nIf an issued digital signature certificate needs to be revoked due to key disclosure or other reasons, a third-party tool can be used to mark the certificate invalid and add the certificate to a digital certificate CRL. To load the latest digital signature CRL file to a device, run the software crl load command. After the file is loaded, the device does not verify the digital signature certificate upon next startup."
