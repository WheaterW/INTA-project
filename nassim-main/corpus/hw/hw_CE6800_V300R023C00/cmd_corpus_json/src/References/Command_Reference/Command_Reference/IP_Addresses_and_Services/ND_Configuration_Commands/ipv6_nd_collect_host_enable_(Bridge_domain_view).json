    "ExtraInfo": "proxy ND or converts multicast streams to unicast streams. If not, the device forwards the NS message based on the original process.\nAfter NS multicast suppression is enabled, in Layer 2 interworking scenarios, run the ipv6 nd collect host enable command in the BD view to enable the flooding of proxy ND entries generated on a device through EVPN routes.\nWhen another device receives the flooded ND entries or proxy ND entries, a proxy ND table is generated on the local. In this manner, when the device receives NS messages again, it searches the local proxy ND table first. If a matching entry exists, the device simply implements proxy ND or converts multicast streams to unicast streams."
