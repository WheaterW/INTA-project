    "ExtraInfo": "If multiple multicast Routers are connected to a shared network segment where hosts reside, these multicast Routers automatically elect a unique querier that is responsible for maintaining IGMP group memberships. The timeout period of a group membership is calculated by using the formula: Timeout period of a group membership = Interval for sending general IGMP query messages x Robustness variable + Maximum response time. To set an interval at which an interface sends general IGMP query messages, run the igmp timer query command."
