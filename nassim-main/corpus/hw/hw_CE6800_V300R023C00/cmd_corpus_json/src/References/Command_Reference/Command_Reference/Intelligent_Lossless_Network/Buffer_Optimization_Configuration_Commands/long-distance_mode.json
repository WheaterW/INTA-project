    "ExtraInfo": "After PFC is enabled on an interface, a headroom buffer is allocated from the plane buffer of the interface to a lossless queue, and this headroom buffer will store the packets received after the queue sends PFC notification packets but before the upstream device stops sending packets. When lossless services on the live network have a long communication distance, a larger headroom buffer is required. Otherwise, packet loss may occur.\nThe distance-based headroom buffer check function calculates the theoretically required headroom buffer space based on the configured long-distance mode (that is, link distance) and interface rate. The purpose of this function is to help avoid packet loss, which may occur if the required headroom buffer space is greater than the remaining buffer space of the plane where the current interface resides. After the headroom buffer optimization function is enabled on the interfaces at both ends of a direct link, the interfaces can send detection packets to each other to calculate the required headroom buffer space for lossless transmission on the link."
