    "ExtraInfo": "The arp detect times command sets the aging probe times of dynamic ARP entries to reduce address resolution errors. Before aging a dynamic ARP entry, the system performs ARP probe. If the system does not receive any response after the number of probe times reaches the upper limit, the system deletes the ARP entry."
