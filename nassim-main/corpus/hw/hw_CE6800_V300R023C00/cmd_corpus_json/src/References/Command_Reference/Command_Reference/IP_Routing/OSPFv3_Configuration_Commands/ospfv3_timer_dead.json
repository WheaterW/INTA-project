The ospfv3 timer dead command sets the dead interval for the OSPFv3 neighbor in the instance to which an interface belongs. The undo ospfv3 timer dead command restores the default value. By default, the dead interval of OSPFv3 neighbors is 40 seconds on a P2P or broadcast interface, and is 120 seconds on an NBMA or P2MP interface.
