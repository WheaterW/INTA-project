    "ExtraInfo": "A global unicast address equals an IPv4 public network address. Global unicast addresses are for links that can be aggregated and are provided for network service providers. The structure of global unicast addresses allows route-prefix aggregation for limiting the number of global routing entries. A global unicast address is composed of a 48-bit route prefix managed by operators, a 16-bit subnet ID managed by local nodes, and a 64-bit interface ID.\nConfiguring an IPv6 address with the prefix length of 127 has the following advantages:"
