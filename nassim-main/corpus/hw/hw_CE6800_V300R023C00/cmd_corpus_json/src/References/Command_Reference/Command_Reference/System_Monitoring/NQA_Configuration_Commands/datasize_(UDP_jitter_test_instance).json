    "ExtraInfo": "The datasize command sets the size of the data field in a test packet. This ensures that the size of the test packet is closer to the size of the actual data packet and the statistics obtained is more accurate.\nFor example, if a UDP jitter test instance is used to detect VoIP services, you can run the datasize command to set the size of the data field in a test packet to have the same size as the actual voice packet so as to simulate the actual traffic in a period of time."
