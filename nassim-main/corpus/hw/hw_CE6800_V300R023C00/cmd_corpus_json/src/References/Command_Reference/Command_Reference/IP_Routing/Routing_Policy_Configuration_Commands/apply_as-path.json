    "ExtraInfo": "The AS_Path attribute is a private attribute of BGP used to record all ASs that a route passes through from the local area to the destination in distance-vector (DV) order. The AS_Path attribute can be used to control route selection and prevent routing loops. When the filtering conditions specified by if-match clauses are met and the matching mode is set to permit, you can use the apply as-path command to set the AS_Path attributes of the routes that match the filtering conditions."
