    "ExtraInfo": "Link states on an IS-IS network are synchronized through LSP flooding. The flooding of LSPs is a mode in which a device sends an LSP to its neighboring devices and the neighboring devices send the received LSP to their respective neighbors except the device that first sends the LSP. In this manner, the LSP is flooded among the devices of the same level. By this flooding, each device of the same level can learn the same LSP information to synchronize its LSDB.\nThe flooding of LSPs needs to be refreshed periodically, because when a device generates the system LSP, it fills in the maximum lifetime for this LSP. After other devices receive this LSP, the Keepalive time of the LSP is reduced continuously. If a device does not receive any more refreshed LSPs and the lifetime of the LSP is reduced to 0, the LSP will be deleted 60s later if no more new refreshed LSPs are received.\nThe timer lsp-refresh command configures an LSP refresh interval to keep the LSPs valid and control the network convergence speed."
