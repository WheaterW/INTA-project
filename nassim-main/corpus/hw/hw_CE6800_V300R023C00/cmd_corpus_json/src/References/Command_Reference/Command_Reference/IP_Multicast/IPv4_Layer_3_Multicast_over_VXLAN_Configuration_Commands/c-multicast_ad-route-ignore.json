    "ExtraInfo": "In the scenario where the IPv4 Layer 3 multicast Over VXLAN is deployed, when the BGP MVPN neighbor receives the C-multicast route, it ignores whether the local A-D route exists during the route validity check, so that the received C-multicast route is valid. In this way, the M-LAG implements the active-active gateway."
