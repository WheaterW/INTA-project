    "ExtraInfo": "The peer next-hop-local command is usually run on an ASBR. By default, when an ASBR forwards a route learned from an EBGP peer to its IBGP peers, the ASBR does not change the Next_Hop of the route. Therefore, the Next_Hop address of the route remains the EBGP peer IP address. After being forwarded to the IBGP peers, the route cannot become active because of the unreachable Next_Hop. The peer next-hop-local command needs to be run to configure the ASBR to modify the Next_Hop of the route to the local IP address before advertising the route to IBGP peers. After being forwarded to the IBGP peers, the route can be active because the Next_Hop is reachable (an IGP is configured in the AS).\nThe peer next-hop-local command is valid only for the labeled routes and VPNv4 routes on a BGP route reflector. If the keyword reflect-effective is configured, the command is valid for MVPN address family routes, IPv6 MVPN address family routes, and MDT address family routes. To configure a BGP device to set its IP address as the next hop of other types of routes, you can apply an export policy."
