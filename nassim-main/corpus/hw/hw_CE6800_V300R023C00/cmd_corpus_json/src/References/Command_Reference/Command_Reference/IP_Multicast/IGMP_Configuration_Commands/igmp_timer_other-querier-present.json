The igmp timer other-querier-present command sets the keepalive period for other IGMP queriers on an interface. The undo igmp timer other-querier-present command restores the default setting. By default, if the default values of the robustness variable, the interval for sending IGMP general query messages, and the maximum response time of IGMP Query messages are used, the keepalive period of other IGMP queriers is 125s. The formula used to calculate the keepalive period of other IGMP queriers is: Keepalive period of other IGMP queriers = Robustness variable x Interval for sending IGMP general query messages + 1/2 x Maximum response time of IGMP Query messages.",

    "ExtraInfo": "When multiple multicast Routers are connected to a network segment where user hosts reside, one of these multicast Router is elected as the querier that is responsible for periodically sending Query messages to the network segment. If the non-queriers do not receive any Query message from the querier within the keepalive period of other IGMP queriers, they consider the querier invalid and automatically trigger a new round of querier election. To set the keepalive period of other IGMP queriers, run the igmp timer other-querier-present command.\nIn IGMPv1, the querier is determined by PIM; in IGMPv2, the Router that has the lowest IP address functions as the querier on a shared network segment."
