    "ExtraInfo": "If the destinations and costs of the multiple routes discovered by one routing protocol are the same, load balancing can be implemented among them, improving link usage on a network and reducing the network congestion caused by some overloaded links. However, routes are randomly selected for forwarding traffic, which complicates service traffic management. To address this problem, run the maximum load-balancing command to set the maximum number of equal-cost routes for load balancing based on network requirements."
