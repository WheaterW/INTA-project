    "ExtraInfo": "During network planning and deployment, if the DSCP value of a device is determined, configure the device to send protocol packets carrying this DSCP value. After the upstream device receives the protocol packets, it can schedule the packets into different queues based on the DSCP values in the packets. This allows packets sent from devices of higher priorities to be scheduled preferentially."
