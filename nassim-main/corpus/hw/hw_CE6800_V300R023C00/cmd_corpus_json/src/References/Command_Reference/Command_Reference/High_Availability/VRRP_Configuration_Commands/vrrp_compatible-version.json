    "ExtraInfo": "If different VRRP versions are configured for devices in a VRRP backup group, a VRRPv2-enabled device receives only VRRPv2 Advertisement packets. After the VRRPv2-enabled device receives VRRPv3 Advertisement packets, it discards them. As a result, the devices in the VRRP backup group cannot negotiate their status. To resolve this issue, run the vrrp version-3 send-packet-mode command to configure a VRRPv3-enabled device to send VRRPv2 Advertisement packets so that the VRRPv2- and VRRPv3-enabled devices can negotiate their status."
