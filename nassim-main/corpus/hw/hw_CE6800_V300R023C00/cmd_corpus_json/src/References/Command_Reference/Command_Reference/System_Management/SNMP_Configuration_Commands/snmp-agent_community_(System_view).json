    "ExtraInfo": "The snmp-agent community command is used on SNMPv1 and SNMPv2C networks. A community is a combination of the NMS and SNMP agent and is identified by a community name. The community name functions as a password for authentication during device communication in a community. Devices can communicate if the community name of the NMS matches that of the SNMP agent. The snmp-agent community command configures a community name on a device so that the NMS can communicate with the device. Parameters in the snmp-agent community command include the access authority, ACL, and accessible MIB views mapped to a community name."
