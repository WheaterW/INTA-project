    "ExtraInfo": "By default, the ID of each Eth-Trunk member interface on DeviceB and DeviceC is assigned by the system. When DeviceA is dual-homed to DeviceB and DeviceC through an Eth-Trunk interface in LACP mode, the IDs of Eth-Trunk member interfaces on DeviceB and DeviceC may be the same, causing LACP negotiation failure or the failure in locating forwarding interfaces. To ensure that the dual-homed Eth-Trunk interface in LACP mode can forward traffic and implement load balancing, run the lacp port-id-extension enable command on either DeviceB or DeviceC to increase the ID of each member interface of the Eth-Trunk interface in LACP mode by 32768. As a result, the IDs of Eth-Trunk member interfaces on DeviceB and DeviceC are not the same."
