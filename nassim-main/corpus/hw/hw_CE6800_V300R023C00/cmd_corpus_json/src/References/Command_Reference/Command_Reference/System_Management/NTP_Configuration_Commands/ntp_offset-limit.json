If the time offset between the clock source and the client is greater than the offset threshold, the client does not synchronize the time of the clock source.\nThe undo ntp offset-limit command deletes the clock synchronization offset threshold. The ntp offset-limit command sets the offset threshold for clock synchronization. If the time offset between the clock source and the client is greater than the offset threshold, the client does not synchronize the time of the clock source. The undo ntp offset-limit command deletes the clock synchronization offset threshold. By default, no offset threshold is set for clock synchronization on a client.",
