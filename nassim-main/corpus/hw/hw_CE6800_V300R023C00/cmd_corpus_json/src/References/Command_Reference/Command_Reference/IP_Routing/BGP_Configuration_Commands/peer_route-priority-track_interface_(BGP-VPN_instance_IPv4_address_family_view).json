When the M-LAG member interface pointing to the peer fails (if there are multiple member interfaces between the M-LAG and the peer, the M-LAG considers that the peer fails only when all interfaces fail): After detecting the status change of the member interface, BGP adjusts the priority of the route received from the specified peer to the lowest (the MED is adjusted to the maximum value and the Local_Pref is adjusted to the minimum value).\nAfter BGP is configured to detect the Eth-Trunk interface status and adjust the route priority, BGP adjusts the priority of the route received from the specified peer to the lowest (the MED is adjusted to the maximum value and the Local_Pref is adjusted to the minimum value) after detecting the interface status change."
