    "ExtraInfo": "Monitoring bandwidth usage helps you keep track of the load on a device. If the bandwidth usage exceeds a specified threshold, bandwidth resources are insufficient, and the device capacity needs to be expanded. For example, if the bandwidth usage exceeds 95%, an alarm is generated, indicating that bandwidth resources are almost exhausted. As a result, some services may be interrupted before device capacity is expanded. In this case, run the trap-threshold command to configure an alarm threshold and a clear alarm threshold for inbound or outbound bandwidth usage. This ensures that device capacity is expanded in advance to prevent service interruption caused by bandwidth exhaustion.\nThe outbound bandwidth usage on an interface is calculated using the following formula: Outbound bandwidth usage (Ratio of the traffic sent by the interface to the total bandwidth of the interface) = (Outbound traffic rate on an interface/Bandwidth of the physical interface) * 100\nThe inbound bandwidth usage on an interface is calculated using the following formula: Inbound bandwidth usage (Ratio of the traffic received by the interface to the total bandwidth of the interface) = (Inbound traffic rate on an interface/Bandwidth of the physical interface) * 100\nSpecify parameters in the trap-threshold command as required,triggering a log alarm when the threshold is reached.\nRun the trap-threshold input-rate bandwidth-in-use resume-rate resume-threshold command to set an alarm threshold and a clear alarm threshold for inbound bandwidth usage."
