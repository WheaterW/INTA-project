    "ExtraInfo": "On a Layer 2 network running STP, ports connected to terminals do not need to participate in spanning tree calculation. You can run the stp edged-port enable command to configure a port connecting to a terminal as an edge port, because an edge port does not participate in spanning tree calculation. This speeds up network convergence and improves network stability. An edge port will no longer be an edge port after receiving BPDUs. To prevent an edge port from receiving bogus BPDUs from attackers, run the stp bpdu-protection command to configure BPDU protection."
