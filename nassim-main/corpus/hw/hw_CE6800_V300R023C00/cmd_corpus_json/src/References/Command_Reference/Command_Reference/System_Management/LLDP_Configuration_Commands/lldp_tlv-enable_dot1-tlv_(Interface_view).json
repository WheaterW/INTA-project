    "ExtraInfo": "A TLV is the basic information unit of an LLDPDU. A device encapsulates information about its main capabilities, management address, device ID, and interface ID into TLVs, encapsulates multiple TLVs into an LLDPDU, and encapsulates an LLDPDU into an LLDP packet. A device exchanges information with neighbors using LLDP packets. During the process of exchanging LLDP packets between devices, the LLDPDU encapsulated in an LLDP packet carries various TLVs as needed. A device sends its status information and receives neighbor status information based on these different TLVs.\nTLVs that can be encapsulated into an LLDPDU include basic TLVs, TLVs defined by IEEE 802.1, TLVs defined by IEEE 802.3, and DCBX TLVs."
