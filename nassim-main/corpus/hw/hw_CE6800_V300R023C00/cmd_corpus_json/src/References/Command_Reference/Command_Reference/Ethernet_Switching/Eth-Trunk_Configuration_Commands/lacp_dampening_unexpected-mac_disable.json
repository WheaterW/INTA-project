    "ExtraInfo": "By default, an Eth-Trunk interface in LACP mode is enabled to suppress invalid MAC addresses in Ethernet headers of received LACPDUs from flapping, in which case the source MAC addresses of the LACPDUs and system ID are checked. To disable the check, run the lacp dampening unexpected-mac disable command to disable MAC address flapping suppression in Ethernet headers of LACPDUs."
