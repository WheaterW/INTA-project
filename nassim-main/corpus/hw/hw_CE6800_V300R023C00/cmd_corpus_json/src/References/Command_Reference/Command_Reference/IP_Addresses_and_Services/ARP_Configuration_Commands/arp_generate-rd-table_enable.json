    "ExtraInfo": "In the NFVI distributed gateway scenario where BGP EVPN peer relationships are established between L2GWs/L3GWs and DC-GWs, L2GWs or L3GWs learn MAC address and ARP information of interface processing units through the data plane and advertise the information to DC-GWs through EVPN routes. This allows ARP entries to be generated for Layer 2 forwarding and ensures that user services run properly. To enable a device to generate ARP entries based on host information synchronized from EVPN routes, run the arp generate-rd-table enable command."
