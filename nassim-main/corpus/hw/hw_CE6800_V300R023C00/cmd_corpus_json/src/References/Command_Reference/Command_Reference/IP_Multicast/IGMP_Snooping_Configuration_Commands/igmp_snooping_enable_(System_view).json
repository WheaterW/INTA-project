It maintains multicast forwarding entries by listening to multicast protocol packets transmitted between the upstream device and hosts, thereby controlling multicast data packet forwarding. Enabling IGMP snooping is the prerequisite for implementing Layer 2 multicast. The igmp snooping enable command can be used to enable IGMP snooping.\nThe differences between the command configuration in the system view and that in the VLAN view are listed as follows:"
