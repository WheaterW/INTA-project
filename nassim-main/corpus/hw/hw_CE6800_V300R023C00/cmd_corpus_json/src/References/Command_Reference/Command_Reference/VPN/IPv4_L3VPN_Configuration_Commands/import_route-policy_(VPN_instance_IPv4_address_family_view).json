    "ExtraInfo": "If no import route-policy is configured, the routes to be imported into the VPN instance IPv4 address family can be filtered only based on the export VPN targets of the routes and the import VPN targets of the VPN instances. To control the import of the routes into the VPN instance IPv4 address family more precisely, use an import route-policy. An import route-policy can filter the routes imported by the VPN instance IPv4 address family and set the attributes for routes that pass the filtering. Routes are filtered based on their export VPN targets and the import VPN targets of the VPN instance and then based on the import route-policy.\nThe import route-policy command controls route leaking from the BGP-VPNv4 address family into a VPN instance. The peer route-policy or filter-policy configured in the BGP VPN instance IPv4 address family view filters the routes in the VPN instance IPv4 address family advertised to or received from CE peers."
