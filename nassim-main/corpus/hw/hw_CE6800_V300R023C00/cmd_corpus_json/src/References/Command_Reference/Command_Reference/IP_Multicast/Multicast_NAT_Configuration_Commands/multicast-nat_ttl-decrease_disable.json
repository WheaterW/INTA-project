When a multicast packet passes through the device, the TTL value of the packet is reduced by 1. The multicast-nat ttl-decrease disable command disables the function of reducing the TTL value of multicast packets so that the TTL value of multicast packets does not decrease by 1 when the packets pass through the device. The undo multicast-nat ttl-decrease disable command enables the function of reducing the TTL value of multicast packets. When a multicast packet passes through the device, the TTL value of the packet is reduced by 1. By default, the function of reducing the TTL value of multicast packets is enabled.

    "ExtraInfo": "In multicast NAT, input and output multicast streams are sent through different interfaces. In normal situations, the TTL value of a multicast stream decreases by 1 after the stream is sent through an outbound interface. If you do not want the TTL value of a multicast packet to decrease when the multicast packet is sent, run the multicast ttl-reduce disable command to disable the TTL value reduction function for multicast packets."
