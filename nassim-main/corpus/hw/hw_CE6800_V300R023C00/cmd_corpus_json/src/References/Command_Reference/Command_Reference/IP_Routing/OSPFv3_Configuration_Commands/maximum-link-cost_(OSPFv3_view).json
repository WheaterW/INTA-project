    "ExtraInfo": "An OSPFv3 neighbor relationship is re-established when the status of the corresponding OSPFv3 interface changes from down to up. After IGP route convergence, services will be switched back. Because the IGP route convergence speed is fast, many services that depend on IGP routes may expect a delayed IGP route switchback. This delay can be achieved using the ospfv3 peer hold-max-cost command, allowing OSPFv3 to set the link cost in local LSAs to LSInfinity (65535) for a period of time. However, as defined in the corresponding standard protocol, the links with the cost 65535 cannot participate in FRR route calculation. To resolve this issue, the maximum-link-cost command can be used to change link costs."
