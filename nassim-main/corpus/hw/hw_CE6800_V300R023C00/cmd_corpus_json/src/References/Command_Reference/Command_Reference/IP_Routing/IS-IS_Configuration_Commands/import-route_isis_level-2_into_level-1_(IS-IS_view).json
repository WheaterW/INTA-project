As a result, Routers in the Level-1 area forward traffic to the nearest Level-1-2 router, and sub-optimal routes may be generated.\nTo address this problem, you can run the import-route isis level-2 into level-1 command to enable IS-IS route leaking from a Level-2 area to a Level-1 area to help Level-1 routers select the optimal route for traffic forwarding.\nThe import-route isis level-2 into level-1 command can be run only on Level-1-2 routers to enable IS-IS route leaking of all or some of the Level-2 routes to the Level-1 area."
