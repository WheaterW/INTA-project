    "ExtraInfo": "OSPF can automatically calculate the link cost of an interface based on the interface bandwidth or have the link cost set using the ospf cost command. When there are multiple routes with the same discovery protocol, cost, and destination address, these routes meet the conditions for load balancing. You can determine whether to perform load balancing by changing the interface cost according to the actual networking.\nIf the cost of a multi-area adjacency interface is not set using the ospf cost multi-area command, OSPF automatically calculates the cost of the interface based on the interface bandwidth. The calculation formula is as follows: Cost of an interface = Bandwidth reference value/Interface bandwidth. The integer of the calculation result is used as the cost of the interface. If the calculation result is smaller than 1, the cost of the interface is 1. You can change the cost of an interface by changing the bandwidth reference value.\nBy default, the bandwidth reference value of OSPF is 100 Mbit/s, and the cost of an Ethernet (100 Mbit/s) interface is 1.\nThe bandwidth of a trunk interface is the sum of all member interfaces, and the member interfaces are variable. Therefore, the trunk interface does not have a default interface cost."
