    "ExtraInfo": "In the VPN scenario, one VPN can communicate with another VPN if they have matching VPN targets, but VPNs cannot communicate with the public network. To enable a VPN to communicate with the public network, you have to ensure that the VPN and public network can obtain routes to each other. To import the VPN instance routes to public network, run the ip import-rib vpn-instance command.\nIn an intelligent traffic control scenario, traffic of different users are distributed to different VPNs. To enable public-network traffic to reach the VPNs, run the ip import-rib vpn-instance command to import routes in each VPN instance routing table to the public network routing table.\nTraffic forwarding relies on direct routes (Vlink direct routes) generated based on user entries. When VLAN tag termination sub-interfaces are used for route import between VPN and public network, Vlink direct routes cannot be imported. As a result, traffic forwarding is interrupted. To solve this problem, route import between VPN and public network newly supports import of Vlink direct routes."
