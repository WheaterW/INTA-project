    "ExtraInfo": "If the recursion result of BGP routes changes frequently, you can run the nexthop recursive-lookup delay command to configure BGP to respond to the recursion result change after a specified period of time. This reduces unnecessary route re-selection and re-advertisement; however, this affects network convergence. Therefore, recursion changes are classified into two types. For details, see Configuring a Delay in Responding to BGP Next Hop Recursion Changes in the Configuration Guide."
