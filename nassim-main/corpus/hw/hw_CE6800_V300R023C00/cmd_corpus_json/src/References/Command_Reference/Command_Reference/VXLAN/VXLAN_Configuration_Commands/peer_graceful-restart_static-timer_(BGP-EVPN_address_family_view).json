Even if you run the graceful-restart timer restart time command in the BGP view, the maximum wait time can be changed to 3600s at most. If some BGP EVPN sessions take more than 3600s to re-establish due to poor network conditions, you can run the peer graceful-restart static-timer command to set a proper wait time for a specified peer."
