In case of heavy network traffic, if hosts or ports are frequently unreachable, devices send a large number of ICMP packets, which causes heavy traffic burden and performance deterioration. In addition, network attackers often use ICMP error packets to spy on the internal structure of the network.\nTo improve network performance and security, run the icmp send disable command to disable the system from sending ICMP packets of a specified type.\nIf you want to restore the default configuration and the display this command output does not contain the icmp send disable or undo icmp send disable command configuration, run the clear icmp send command."
