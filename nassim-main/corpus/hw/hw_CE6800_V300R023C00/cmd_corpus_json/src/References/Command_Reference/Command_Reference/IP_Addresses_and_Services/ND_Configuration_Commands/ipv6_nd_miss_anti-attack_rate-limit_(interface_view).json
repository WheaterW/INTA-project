    "ExtraInfo": "When a device sends an IPv6 packet, if the MAC address corresponding to the destination IPv6 address of the IPv6 packet does not exist, an ND Miss message is generated. This consumes device resources and affects the processing of other services. To resolve this problem, run the ipv6 nd miss anti-attack rate-limit command to configure the rate at which ND Miss messages are sent. With this configuration, the device processes only the allowed number of ND Miss messages within a specified period to ensure normal service running."
