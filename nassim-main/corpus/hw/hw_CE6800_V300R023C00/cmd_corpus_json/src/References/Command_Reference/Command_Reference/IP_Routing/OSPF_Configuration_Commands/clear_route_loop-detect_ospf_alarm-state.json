    "ExtraInfo": "After detecting an OSPF routing loop, the device reports an alarm. The device cannot automatically detect whether the loop is rectified. Therefore, you need to run this command to disable the device from advertising a large link cost for imported routes and manually clear the OSPF loop alarm after detecting and rectifying the loop. If this command is executed when the routing loop problem is not resolved, the alarm is reported again."
