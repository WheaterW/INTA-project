    "ExtraInfo": "When VRRP is used for gateway redundancy on the live network, the master device has heavy loads, whereas the backup devices have light loads. In traditional VRRP load balancing mode, multiple VRRP backup groups with virtual IP addresses are created and specified as gateways for different users to implement load balancing. To simplify user configurations, create an LBRG and specify it as a gateway for all users to implement load balancing.\nAfter you configure an LBRG, the LBRG returns different MAC addresses for ARP request packets from different users. The master device of a specified VRRP backup group forwards the traffic of a specified user."
