    "ExtraInfo": "This command applies to DHCP servers. If user hosts access hosts on the network by domain names, user hosts need to send DNS requests to the DNS server and resolve the domain name to access for communication. To connect a DHCP client to the network, configure a DHCP server address so that the DHCP server can assign both the specified DNS server address and an IP address to the client. To configure DNS server addresses for an interface address pool, run the dhcp server dns-list command."
