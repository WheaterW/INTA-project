    "ExtraInfo": "In an IS-IS dual-homing access scenario, when the traffic rate exceeds the bandwidth of a link, additional links are needed to carry the traffic. If one of the links fails and the bandwidth of the other links is not sufficient enough to carry the traffic, traffic will get lost. To prevent this problem, run the link-group command to bundle multiple links into a link group and run the cost-offset command to configure a link cost offset to be added to the link cost of the member links when the number of available member links falls below a specified number. After the link cost is adjusted, the traffic forwarding path is changed, preventing traffic loss."
