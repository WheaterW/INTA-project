The vrrp6 vrid timer advertise command configures an interval at which the master router in a Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol for IPv6 (VRRP6) backup group sends VRRP6 Advertisement packets. The undo vrrp6 vrid timer advertise command restores the default interval. By default, the master device in a VRRP6 group sends VRRP6 Advertisement packets at an interval of 1 second.

    "ExtraInfo": "The master router in a VRRP6 backup group periodically sends VRRP6 Advertisement packets to the backup routers in the group to notify them of its status. If the backup routers do not receive VRRP6 Advertisement packets from the master router after a period three times (As defined in relevant standards protocols: Interval specified by master-down-interval= (256 - priority)/256 + 3 x timer. According to the formula, the default interval specified by master-down-interval is about three times the interval specified by advertise-interval.) if the interval at which VRRP6 Advertisement packets are sent, the master router is considered Down and the backup router with the highest priority becomes the master router. If a backup router does not receive a VRRP6 Advertisement packet within a specified timeout period due to heavy network traffic or timer differences, a master/backup VRRP6 switchover is performed.\nTo prevent this situation, configure a large interval at which the master router sends VRRP6 Advertisement packets. To configure an interval at which the master router in a VRRP6 backup group sends VRRP6 Advertisement packets, run the vrrp6 vrid timer advertise command."
