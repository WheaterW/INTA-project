    "ExtraInfo": "The single-fiber receiving function allows you to connect the RX end of a local optical module to a remote optical module using a single optical fiber so that the local interface can only receive packets but cannot send packets. You can configure this function on an optical interface when an optical module (not a single-fiber bidirectional optical module) is installed or the transmission medium is pre-configured on the interface. The local interface goes Up only when both the local and remote optical modules are installed and can properly receive optical signals. With this function, the device can only receive packets but cannot send packets. This function ensures data security on the device and allows you to obtain the real physical status of the interface."
