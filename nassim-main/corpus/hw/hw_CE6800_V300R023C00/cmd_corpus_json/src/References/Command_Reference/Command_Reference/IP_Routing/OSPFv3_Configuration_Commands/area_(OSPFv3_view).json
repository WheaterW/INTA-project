    "ExtraInfo": "The number of devices increases with the network expansion, which leads to a large LSDB on each OSPFv3-enabled device on a large-scale network. Consequently, route flapping frequently occurs, and a large number of OSPFv3 packets are transmitted on the network, which wastes bandwidth resources.\nOSPFv3 addresses the preceding problem by logically partitioning an AS into different areas."
