    "ExtraInfo": "On a network where a spanning tree protocol is enabled, a device checks whether the BPDUs received from an upstream device time out based on the set Max Age value. If the received BPDUs time out, the device ages the BPDUs and blocks the port that receives the BPDUs. Then, the device sends the BPDUs with the device as the root bridge. This aging mechanism effectively controls the diameter of the spanning tree. After the stp vlan timer max-age command is run, the Max Age value is set to control the timeout period of received BPDUs."
