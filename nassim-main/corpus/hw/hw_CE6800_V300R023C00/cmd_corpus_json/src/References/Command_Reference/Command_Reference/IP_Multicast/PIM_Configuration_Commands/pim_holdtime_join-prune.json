    "ExtraInfo": "After receiving a Join/Prune message from a downstream interface, an upstream Router determines the time period for keeping the join or prune state of a downstream interface based on the holdtime field carried in the Join/Prune message. To set a value for the holdtime field of Join/Prune messages sent by a specified PIM interface, run the pim holdtime join-prune command on the interface.\nGenerally, the holdtime is 3.5 times the interval (specified using the timer join-prune command) at which Join/Prune messages are sent."
