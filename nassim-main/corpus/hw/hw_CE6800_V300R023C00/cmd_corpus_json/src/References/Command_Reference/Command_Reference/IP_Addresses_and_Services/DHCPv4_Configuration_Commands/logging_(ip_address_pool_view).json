When the DHCP server allocates IP addresses to clients, it records address allocation information to facilitate routine maintenance and fault location. After the logging function during IP address allocation of the DHCP server is configured using the logging command, the DHCP server records logs about address allocation, conflict, lease renewal, and release."
