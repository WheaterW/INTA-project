    "ExtraInfo": "Base-R FEC is a bit error correction mode. In this mode, error correction information is added to data packets at the transmit end, and the error correction information is used at the receive end to correct bit errors generated during data packet transmission. You can enable the Base-R FEC function to improve signal quality.\nYou can run the display interface command in any view or the display this interface command in the interface view to check the FEC status on the interface.\nWhen two interfaces are connected, ensure that the FEC status on both ends of the link is the same. One end must be Base-R FEC, and the other end must also be Base-R FEC."
