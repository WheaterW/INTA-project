    "ExtraInfo": "The dhcp server next-server command is used on DHCP servers. When assigning a DHCP client an IP address, a DHCP server can also assign the DHCP client an IP address of the server that provides network services for the client. For example, some clients like IP phones still need other configuration parameters after automatically obtaining IP addresses. You can run the dhcp server next-server command to specify the server address used after a client obtains an IP address. The client then requests the configuration parameters from the specified server after obtaining an IP address."
