    "ExtraInfo": "If multiple MSDP peers exist on a network, source active (SA) messages may be flooded between peers. Especially when many MSDP peers are configured in the same PIM-SM domain, reverse path forwarding (RPF) rules cannot filter out useless SA messages effectively. The MSDP peer needs to perform the RPF check on each received SA message, which brings heavy workload to the system.\nTo reduce the number of SA messages transmitted between MSDP peers and the system workload, run the peer mesh-group command to add MSDP peers to a mesh group."
