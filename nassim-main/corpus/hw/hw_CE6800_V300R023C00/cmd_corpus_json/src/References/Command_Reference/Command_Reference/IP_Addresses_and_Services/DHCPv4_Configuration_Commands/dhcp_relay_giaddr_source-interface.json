    "ExtraInfo": "In a distributed gateway scenario, configure the DHCP relay function on the gateway interface of each distributed gateway. The DHCP relay agent fills the giaddr field with the IP address of the gateway interface in the request packet sent to the DHCP server. Based on the giaddr field, the DHCP server sets the destination IP address of the response packet to the IP address of the gateway interface. However, because the gateway interfaces of distributed gateways have the same IP address, the response packet from the DHCP server may be sent back to other distributed gateways (not the device that sends the request packet). As a result, users cannot obtain IP addresses. To solve the preceding problems, you can configure a source interface for DHCP relay packets on each distributed gateway. Then, the DHCP relay agent uses the primary IP address of the interface to fill in the giaddr field to communicate with the DHCP server. The IP address of the source interface can communicate with the DHCP server, and the IP address is unique on all distributed gateways. Therefore, the response packets from the DHCP server can be sent to the correct distributed gateways.When a user and a DHCP server are located in different VPNs, if the DHCP relay agent still uses the IP address of the relay interface as the relay agent address, the DHCP server cannot communicate with the DHCP relay agent through this address, and DHCP reply packets are unreachable. To solve this problem, run the dhcp relay giaddr source-interface command to configure the IP address of the source interface as the relay agent address so that the DHCP reply packets from the DHCP server can be forwarded to the DHCP relay agent."
