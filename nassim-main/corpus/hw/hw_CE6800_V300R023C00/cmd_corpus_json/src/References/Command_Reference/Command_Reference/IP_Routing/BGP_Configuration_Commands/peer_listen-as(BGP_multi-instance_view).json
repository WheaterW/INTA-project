    "ExtraInfo": "The dynamic BGP peer function enables BGP to listen for BGP connection requests from a specified network segment, dynamically establish BGP peer relationships, and add these peers to the same dynamic peer group. This spares you from adding or deleting BGP peer configurations in response to each change in dynamic peers. To specify a peer AS from which a dynamic EBGP peer group listens for BGP connection requests, run the peer listen-as command."
