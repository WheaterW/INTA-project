    "ExtraInfo": "Generally, BGP uses AS numbers to detect routing loops. The AS numbers in the AS_Path of each received route are matched against the local AS number configured using the bgp command and the fake AS number configured using the peer fake-as command. The largest number of times any of the configured AS numbers is repeated is considered as the routing loop count. However, in Hub and Spoke networking, if EBGP runs between a Hub-PE and a Hub-CE, the routes that the Hub-PE sends to the Hub-CE carry the AS number of the Hub-PE; if the Hub-CE sends an Update message to the Hub-PE, the Hub-PE discards the message because the message includes the AS number of the Hub-PE.\nTo ensure proper route transmission in the Hub and Spoke networking, configure all the BGP peers on the path, along which the Hub-CE advertises VPN routes to the Spoke-CE, to accept the routes that contain the local AS number as long as the number of repetitions in each route is within the default limit (1)."
