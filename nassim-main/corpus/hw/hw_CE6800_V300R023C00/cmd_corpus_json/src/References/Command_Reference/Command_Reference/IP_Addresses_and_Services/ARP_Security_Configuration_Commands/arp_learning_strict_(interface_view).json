    "ExtraInfo": "The attacker sends a large number of stimulate ARP request and reply messages to a device on a network. As a result, the ARP buffer is overflowed and unable to cache normal ARP entries. Enabling strict ARP learning can address such a problem. Strict ARP learning allows a device to receive only ARP reply message in response to the request sent by itself, ensuring the device security."
