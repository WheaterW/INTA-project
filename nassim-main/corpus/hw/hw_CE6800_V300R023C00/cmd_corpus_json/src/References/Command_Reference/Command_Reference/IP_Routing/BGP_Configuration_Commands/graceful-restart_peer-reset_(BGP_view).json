    "ExtraInfo": "Currently, BGP does not support dynamic capability negotiation. Therefore, BGP capability changes cause peer relationships to be re-established and routing entries to be deleted, interrupting services. To solve this problem, run the graceful-restart peer-reset command to enable the device to reset BGP connections in GR mode after GR is enabled globally.\nAfter the function of resetting a BGP connection in GR mode is configured, if a BGP peer relationship in another address family is established based on the BGP IPv4 unicast peer session, BGP enters GR and renegotiates capabilities. During this process, the BGP IPv4 unicast peer session is re-established. The original routing entries, however, are not deleted, and the forwarding module can still guide packet forwarding according to the routing information. This ensures that IPv4 services are not interrupted.\nIt is recommended that you enable this function when establishing BGP peers."
