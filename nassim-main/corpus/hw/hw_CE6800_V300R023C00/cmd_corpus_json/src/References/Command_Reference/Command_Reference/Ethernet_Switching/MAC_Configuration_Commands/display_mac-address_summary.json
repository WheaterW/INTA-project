    "ExtraInfo": "A MAC address table is an interface-based Layer 2 forwarding table. It stores information about MAC addresses learned by a device. A MAC address entry contains a MAC address, an interface on which a packet is forwarded to this MAC address, and a VLAN to which the specified interface belongs or a VSI to which the specified interface is bound. Before forwarding a packet, the device searches the MAC address table based on the destination MAC address of the packet and locates the outbound interface quickly. This facilitates packet forwarding and reduces broadcast traffic.\nIf a device learns a great number of MAC addresses of different types, run the display mac-address summary command to view statistics about the MAC address entries on the device."
