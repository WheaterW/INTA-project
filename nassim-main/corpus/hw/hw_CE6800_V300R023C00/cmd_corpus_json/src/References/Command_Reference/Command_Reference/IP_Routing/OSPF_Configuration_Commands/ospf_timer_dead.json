The ospf timer dead command sets a dead interval for the OSPF neighbor in the instance to which an interface belongs. The undo ospf timer dead command restores the default value. By default, the dead interval of OSPF neighbors is 40 seconds on a P2P or broadcast interface, and is 120 seconds on an NBMA or P2MP interface.",

    "ExtraInfo": "If no Hello packet is received from a neighbor within a dead interval, the neighbor is considered invalid. The dead interval on OSPF interfaces must be greater than the transmission interval of Hello messages. In addition, the dead intervals of devices on the same network segment must be the same.\nBy default, the dead interval of OSPF neighbors is four times the transmission interval of Hello messages."
