    "ExtraInfo": "If PIM-SM MDT setup does not span MVPN tunnels, an RP can be deployed on a PE or CE. If a CE is configured as an RP, the CE needs to establish an MSDP peer relationship with its connected PE. To transmit the (S, G) entry information learned through the BGP Source Active A-D route to the remote CE, run the export msdp command."
