    "ExtraInfo": "The priority of an interface determines whether the interface is qualified to be a DR or BDR. The interface with the highest priority is elected as the DR or BDR. If the priority of an interface on a device is 0, the device cannot be elected as a DR or BDR. On a broadcast or an NBMA network, you can set the priority of an interface to control the DR or BDR selection.\nProcedure\nIn OSPFv3, the DR priority cannot be configured for null interfaces."
