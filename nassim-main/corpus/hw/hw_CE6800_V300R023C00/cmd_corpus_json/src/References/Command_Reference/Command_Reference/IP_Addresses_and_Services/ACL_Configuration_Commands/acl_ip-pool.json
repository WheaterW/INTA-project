    "ExtraInfo": "In some typical ACL application scenarios, you need to match both the source and destination IP addresses. On a large-scale network, there are tens of thousands of combinations of source and destination IP addresses. It is unreasonable to manually configure tens of thousands of ACL rules to match these source and destination IP addresses at the same time.\nTo reduce the configuration workload, run the acl ip-pool command to create an ACL IP address pool. In this case, you only need to configure an ACL rule with a specified IP address pool name (pool-name) to match multiple IP addresses. In scenarios in which ACL rules are used to match both source and destination IP addresses carried in packets, run the acl ip-pool command to create an ACL source IP address pool (which includes all needed IP addresses) and an ACL destination IP address pool (which includes all needed destination IP addresses), respectively."
