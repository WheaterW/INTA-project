The peer substitute-as command enables AS number substitution in the advertisement direction. That is, the AS number of a specified peer group in the AS_Path attribute is replaced with the local AS number. The undo peer substitute-as command disables AS number substitution.

    "ExtraInfo": "In a BGP public network scenario, when two devices with the same AS number learn a BGP route from each other through the same EBGP peer, the route may be discarded because the AS_Path attribute contains duplicate AS numbers. To prevent this problem, run the peer substitute-as command on this EBGP peer to enable AS number substitution in the advertisement direction."
