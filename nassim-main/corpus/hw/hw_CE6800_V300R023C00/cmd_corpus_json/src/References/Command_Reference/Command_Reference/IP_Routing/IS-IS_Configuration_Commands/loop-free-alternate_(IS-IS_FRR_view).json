    "ExtraInfo": "To provide real-time transmission for network services, traffic must be fast switched if IS-IS faults occur. Configuring IS-IS Auto FRR can fast switch traffic to the backup link before route convergence on the control plane. This ensures uninterrupted traffic transmission. The backup link is calculated based on the LFA algorithm. With the neighbor that can provide the backup link as the root, the shortest path to the destination node is calculated based on the SPF algorithm. Then, the loop-free backup link with the smallest cost is calculated according to the inequality defined in standard protocols."
