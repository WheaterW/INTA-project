Probing whether the neighbor is reachable is not performed unless there is a packet to be sent to this neighbor.\nThe timeout period of the STALE state of ND entries is a variable. If you want to quickly clear invalid ND entries, you can set the timeout period to a smaller value through the ipv6 nd stale-timeout command to speed up entry aging."
