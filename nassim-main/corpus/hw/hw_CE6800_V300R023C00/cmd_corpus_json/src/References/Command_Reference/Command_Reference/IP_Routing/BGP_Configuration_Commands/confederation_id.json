    "ExtraInfo": "A large AS may contain a huge number of fully meshed IBGP peer relationships. To reduce the number of fully meshed IBGP peer relationships in the AS and keep the integrity of the original AS, perform the following operations:\nDivide the AS into multiple sub-ASs and run the confederation id command to configure a BGP confederation. Then establish EBGP connections between sub-ASs and establish fully meshed IBGP connections within the same sub-AS.\nSome key attributes of routes, such as the next hop, MED, and Local_Pref are not discarded when these routes pass through sub-ASs."
