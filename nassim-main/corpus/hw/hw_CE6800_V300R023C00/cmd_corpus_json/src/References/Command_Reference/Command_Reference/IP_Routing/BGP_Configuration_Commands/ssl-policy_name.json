    "ExtraInfo": "The Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol protects data privacy on the Internet by preventing attackers from eavesdropping on data exchanged between a client and a server. Specifically, to ensure data transmission security on a network, an SSL policy needs to be configured for BMP using the ssl-policy name command to associate BMP with the SSL policy, and the SSL data encryption, identity authentication, and message integrity verification mechanisms need to be used."
