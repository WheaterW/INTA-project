    "ExtraInfo": "To configure encryption algorithms on an SSH server, run the ssh server cipher command. The SSH client and server negotiate encryption algorithms for the packets exchanged between them. During negotiation, the client sends the specified encryption algorithms to the server. After comparing the received encryption algorithms with the local ones, the server selects the first matching encryption algorithm received for packet transmission. If no matching encryption algorithm is found, the negotiation fails."
