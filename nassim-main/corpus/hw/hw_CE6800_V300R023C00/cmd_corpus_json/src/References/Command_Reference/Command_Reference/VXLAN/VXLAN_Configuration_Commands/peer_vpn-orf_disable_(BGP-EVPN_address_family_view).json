    "ExtraInfo": "On a network where both EVPN and L3VPN services are deployed, if a PE does not support EVPN ORF due to an earlier version, after BGP-VT peer relationships are established on the entire network and EVPN ORF is enabled on other PEs and RRs, PEs of earlier versions cannot exchange EVPN routes with RRs. As a result, EVPN services cannot run properly. In this case, you can run the peer vpn-orf disable command to disable the RR from filtering routes related to the IRT so that the RR can send and receive EVPN routes properly. This ensures that EVPN services run properly."
