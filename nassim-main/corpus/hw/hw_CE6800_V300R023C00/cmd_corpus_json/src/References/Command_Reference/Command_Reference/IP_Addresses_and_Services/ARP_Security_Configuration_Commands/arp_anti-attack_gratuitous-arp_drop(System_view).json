    "ExtraInfo": "When a device is connected to a network for the first time, the device broadcasts gratuitous ARP packets to announce its existence and checks whether its IP address conflicts with any other device IP address in the broadcast domain. Any device can send gratuitous ARP packets and receive gratuitous ARP packets without authentication. As a result, a large number of gratuitous ARP packets can be generated, causing devices to be busy processing these packets. This process overloads the CPU and affects the processing of other services. To resolve this problem, you can enable gratuitous ARP packet discarding. After gratuitous ARP packet discarding is enabled, the device discards all received gratuitous ARP packets to prevent excessive CPU consumption."
