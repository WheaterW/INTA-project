    "ExtraInfo": "To prevent malicious hosts from constructing pseudo PIM Hello messages to attack a Router, enable PIM silent using the pim silent command on an interface connected to hosts. After PIM silent is enabled on an interface, all PIM packets will be discard by this interface, and all PIM neighbors and PIM state machines will be deleted for this interface. The interface automatically becomes a static designated router (DR). IGMP functions, however, are not affected on the interface."
