    "ExtraInfo": "After the LLDP alarm function is enabled for a device, the device sends alarms to the NMS if LLDP neighbor information changes. If LLDP neighbor information changes frequently, the device frequently sends alarms to an NMS, causing network flapping.\nSetting a delay effectively prevents network flapping caused by alarms being frequently sent to the NMS. To set a delay for the device to send alarms about LLDP neighbor information changes to the NMS, run the lldp trap-interval command."
