    "ExtraInfo": "On a device running ERPS, the VLAN in which ERPS BPDUs and data packets are transmitted must be mapped to a protected instance so that ERPS forwards or blocks these packets based on rules. Otherwise, VLAN packets probably cause broadcast storms on the ring network. This will cause the network to be unavailable."
