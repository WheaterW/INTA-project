    "ExtraInfo": "After DHCP snooping is enabled on a device, the device generates DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 snooping binding entries for users by default. If the number of binding entries on the device reaches the upper limit, new users cannot go online. On a trusted DHCP network, if you do not want to limit the number of online users but want to record user location information, run the dhcp snooping enable no-user-bind command to disable the device from generating DHCP snooping binding entries.\nIf the command is run in the interface view, the command takes effect for all DHCP users connected to the interface. If the command is run in the VLAN view, the command takes effect for DHCP users connected to all interfaces that belong to the VLAN. The configuration in the system view is similar to that in the VLAN view. The difference is that the configuration in the system view takes effect for multiple VLANs."
