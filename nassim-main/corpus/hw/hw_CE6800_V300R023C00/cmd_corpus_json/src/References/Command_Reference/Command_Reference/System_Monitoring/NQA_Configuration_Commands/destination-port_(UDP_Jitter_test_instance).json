    "ExtraInfo": "NQA monitors service features by creating test instances. In NQA, two test ends are called an NQA client and an NQA server. An NQA test is initiated by the NQA client. After test instances are configured on the client, NQA places different types of test instances into various test queues. After the test starts, a response packet is returned. Carriers can then check the operating status about protocols by analyzing the received response packet.\nFor a test instance, the port for accessing the server is specified using the destination port number configured using the destination-port command on the client."
