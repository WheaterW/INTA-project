    "ExtraInfo": "Priorities of devices are an important factor to calculate a spanning tree and determine root bridge selection.On a network running STP/RSTP/MSTP, each spanning tree has only one root bridge responsible for sending Bridge Protocol Data Units (BPDUs). Because the root bridge is of great importance, it is hoped that a device with high performance and network hierarchy can be chosen as the root bridge. However, this cannot be achieved if the device has a low priority. To set a priority for the device, run the stp priority command.You can also run the stp priority command to set a low priority for devices with low performance and network hierarchy so that these devices are not selected as the root bridge.On an MSTP network, each device can be set with a unique priority in each spanning tree instance."
