    "ExtraInfo": "If a policy is configured for route dampening, routes are preferentially matched against the dampening parameters defined by route-policy in the command.\nThe four parameters of the command are mutually dependent. If you configure one of the parameters, the other parameters also need to be configured in the command.\nBGP dampening measures route stability using a penalty value. The greater the penalty value, the less stable a route. Each time route flapping occurs (the device receives a Withdraw), BGP adds a penalty value to the route carried in the message. If a route changes from active to inactive, the penalty value increases by 1000.\nIf the penalty value of a route exceeds the Suppress value, the route is dampened. The device does not add the route to the IP routing table or advertise any Update message to other BGP peers. BGP removes the best flag of the route. If the route is carried in an Update message, BGP adds a d flag to the route; if the route is carried in a Withdraw message, BGP adds an h flag to the route. If a route carries both a d flag and an h flag, the route is considered a deleted one. After the penalty value reaches the penalty ceiling, it does not increase any more.\nThe penalty value of a dampened route reduces by half after a half-life period. If the route is carried in an Update message and its penalty value decreases to the Reuse value, the route becomes reusable, and BGP removes the d flag from it, adds it to the IP routing table if it is an optimal route, and advertises an Update message carrying the route to BGP peers. If the route is carried in a Withdraw message and its penalty value decreases to 0, BGP deletes this route from the BGP routing table.\nAfter BGP route dampening is configured, any parameter in the command can be used to dampen flapping routes. You can adjust the parameters as required. To increase the dampening time of flapping routes, perform any of the following operations (to reduce the dampening time, perform otherwise):"
