    "ExtraInfo": "Data collection by an NMS consumes many CPU resources. To ensure that other service runs properly, the device must reserve some resources for other services. To resolve this issue, run the set configuration operation cpu-limit command to configure a threshold for CPU rate decreasing. If the CPU usage reaches the configured threshold, the device reduces CPU resources allocated to the NMS when the NMS collects data. In this case, CPU pressure can be relieved to some extent."
