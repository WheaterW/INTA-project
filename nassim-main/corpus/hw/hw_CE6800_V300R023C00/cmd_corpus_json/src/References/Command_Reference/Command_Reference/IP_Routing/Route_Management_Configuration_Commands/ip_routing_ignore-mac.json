This configuration allows the device to forward the packets whose destination MAC address is not the local Layer 3 interface's MAC address according to routes.\nThe undo ip routing ignore-mac command restores the default configuration. The ip routing ignore-mac command configures the device to ignore the destination MAC address of packets. This configuration allows the device to forward the packets whose destination MAC address is not the local Layer 3 interface's MAC address according to routes. The undo ip routing ignore-mac command restores the default configuration. By default, the device is not configured to ignore the destination MAC address of packets. This command is supported only on the CE6860-SAN, CE6866K, CE6866, CE6860-HAM, CE6855-48XS8CQ, CE6885-SAN, CE8850-SAN, CE8855, CE8851-32CQ4BQ, CE6885-LL (low latency mode), CE8851K, CE8851-32CQ8DQ-P, CE8850-HAM, CE6885, CE6885-T, CE6885-LL (standard forwarding mode) and CE6863E-48S8CQ.",

    "ExtraInfo": "During network maintenance, traffic is often redirected to a specific device for analysis. In most cases, a device forwards only packets whose destination MAC address is the local Layer 3 interface's MAC address according to routes, and forwards other packets at Layer 2 or discards other packets. If necessary, the device can also forward other packets at Layer 3 after it is configured to ignore the destination MAC address of packets."
