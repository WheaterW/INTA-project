The timer spt-switch command sets the interval for checking whether the rate at which multicast data is transmitted exceeds the threshold that can trigger data switching from a rendezvous point tree (RPT) to a shortest path tree (SPT). The undo timer spt-switch command restores the default value. By default, the interval is 15 seconds.
