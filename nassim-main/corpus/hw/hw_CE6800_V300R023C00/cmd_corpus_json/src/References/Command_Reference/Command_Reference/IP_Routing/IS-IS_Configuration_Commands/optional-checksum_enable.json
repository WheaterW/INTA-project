    "ExtraInfo": "To prevent the attack of malicious packets and to ensure that packets are correctly received on an IS-IS network, you can configure the optional-checksum enable command to enable IS-IS devices to send SNP packets and Hello packets carrying optional checksum TLVs. After the peer device receives the packets, it checks whether the carried optional checksum TLVs are correct. If the TLVs are not correct, the peer device rejects the packets."
