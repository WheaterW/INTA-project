    "ExtraInfo": "Antilocking PFC is a type of PFC technology that enables a device to periodically scan the buffer usage of priority queues on an interface, and then send PFC frames to the upstream device to control the period during which the upstream device stops sending traffic. This allows the device to constantly adjust when traffic is being sent or paused. You can run this command to create an antilocking PFC profile and enter its view."
