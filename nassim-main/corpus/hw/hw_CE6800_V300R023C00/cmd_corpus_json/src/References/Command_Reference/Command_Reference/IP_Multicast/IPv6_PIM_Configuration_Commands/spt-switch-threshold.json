    "FuncDef": "The spt-switch-threshold command sets a multicast data forwarding rate threshold at which a receiver's designated router (DR) performs a switchover from the rendezvous point tree (RPT) to the shortest path tree (SPT).\nThe undo spt-switch-threshold command restores the default value. The spt-switch-threshold command sets a multicast data forwarding rate threshold at which a receiver's designated router (DR) performs a switchover from the rendezvous point tree (RPT) to the shortest path tree (SPT). The undo spt-switch-threshold command restores the default value. By default, a receiver's DR performs a switchover from the RPT to the SPT immediately after receiving the first multicast data packet. This command is supported only on the CE6863H, CE6863H-K, CE6860-SAN, CE6866K, CE6866, CE6860-HAM, CE6855-48XS8CQ, CE6885-SAN, CE8850-SAN, CE8855, CE8851-32CQ4BQ, CE8851K, CE8851-32CQ8DQ-P, CE8850-HAM, CE6881H, CE6881H-K, CE6820H, CE6820H-K, CE6820S, CE6885, CE6885-T, CE6885-LL (standard forwarding mode) and CE6863E-48S8CQ.",

After the switchover is complete, the system does not switch traffic back to the RPT any more.\nThe value is an integer ranging from 1 to 4194304, in kbit/s."
