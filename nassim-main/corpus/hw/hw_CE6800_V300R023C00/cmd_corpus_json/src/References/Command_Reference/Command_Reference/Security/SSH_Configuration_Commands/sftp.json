    "ExtraInfo": "SFTP is short for SSH FTP, which is a secure FTP protocol. SFTP is established over SSH and enables remote users to securely log in to a device for file management and transfer. This ensures data transmission security. In addition, the device provides the SFTP client function so that you can log in to a remote SSH server from the device to securely transfer files.\nWhen the SFTP server or its connection to a client fails, the client must detect the fault in time and release the connection. To achieve this goal, before a client logs in to the server through SFTP, configure an interval at which keepalive packets are sent if no data is received and the maximum number of times that the server does not respond. If the client does not receive any data within the specified interval, it sends a keepalive packet to the server. If the maximum number of times that the server does not respond exceeds the specified value, the client tears down the connection."
