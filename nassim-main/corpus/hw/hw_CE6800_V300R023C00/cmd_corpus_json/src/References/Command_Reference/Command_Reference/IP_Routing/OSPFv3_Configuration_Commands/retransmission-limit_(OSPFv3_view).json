    "ExtraInfo": "The OSPFv3 packet retransmission mechanism applies to DD, Update, and Request packets. If no response packet is received for DD, Update, and Request packets, the neighbor relationship can be disconnected after retransmission is enabled and the number of retransmission times is limited. This prevents neighbor flapping caused by packet loss."
