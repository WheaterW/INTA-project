If a device receives an End-Of-RIB flag from the BGP-VPN-Target address family within the specified period, the device immediately advertises EVPN routes. If the device does not receive the End-Of-RIB flag from the BGP-VPN-Target address family within the period set using this command, EVPN route advertisement is triggered immediately."
