    "ExtraInfo": "If a device's CPU is overloaded, each module needs to take necessary measures to control its own CPU usage accordingly. Upon receiving a CPU overload notification from the system, the OSPF module controls the speeds of some internal computing processes and the establishment of neighbor relationships based on the CPU overload condition to enhance the resilience of OSPF. In this case, new neighbor relationships cannot be established. For original neighbor relationships, if a neighbor relationship is in the Full state, it will be retained; if a neighbor relationship is in a non-Full state, establishment of the neighbor relationship is paused and can continue only after the CPU recovers from overload."
