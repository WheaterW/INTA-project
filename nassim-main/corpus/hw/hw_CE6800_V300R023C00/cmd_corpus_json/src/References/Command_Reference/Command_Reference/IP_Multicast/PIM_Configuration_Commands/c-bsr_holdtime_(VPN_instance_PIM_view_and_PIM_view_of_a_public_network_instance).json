    "ExtraInfo": "To maintain the bootstrap router (BSR) status, a BSR dynamically elected among C-BSRs needs to send bootstrap messages carrying the BSR IP address and the rendezvous point (RP)-set information to the C-BSRs at a specific interval (called BS_interval) that can be set using the c-bsr interval command.\nOnly the BSR sends bootstrap messages, and each C-BSR starts a timer and waits to receive bootstrap messages from the BSR before the timer times out. To set the timeout period (called holdtime) of the timer, run the c-bsr holdtime command."
