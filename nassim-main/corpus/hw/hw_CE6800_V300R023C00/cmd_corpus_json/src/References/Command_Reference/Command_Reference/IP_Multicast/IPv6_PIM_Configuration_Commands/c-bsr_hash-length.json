    "ExtraInfo": "On an IPv6 PIM-SM network where a rendezvous point (RP) is dynamically elected using the BSR mechanism, each candidate-rendezvous point (C-RP) sends to the BSR an Advertisement message carrying the C-RP address, range of multicast groups that the C-RP serves, and C-RP priority. Then, the BSR collects all those information and the BSR hash mask length as an RP-set, encapsulates the RP-set into a bootstrap message, and advertises the message to all routers on the network. All routers use the RP-set and follow the same RP election rules to elect an RP for a specific group.\nThe RP election rules are as follows:"
