    "ExtraInfo": "On an STP/RSTP/MSTP network, devices running different spanning tree protocols cannot communicate with each other. As a result, spanning trees cannot be properly calculated.To resolve this problem, run the stp mode command to configure a proper operation mode for a local device so that the remote device can identify BPDUs sent by the local device. The operation mode can be MSTP, RSTP, or STP.By default, all ports on a device operate in MSTP mode. When a port is directly connected to an STP port, the operation mode of the port is automatically switched to STP."
