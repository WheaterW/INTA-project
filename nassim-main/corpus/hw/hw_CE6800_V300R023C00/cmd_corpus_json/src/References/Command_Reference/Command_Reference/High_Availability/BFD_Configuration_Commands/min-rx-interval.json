To reduce the usage of system resources, when detecting that the BFD session is Down, the system adjusts the interval between receiving BFD packets to a random value greater than 1000 ms. After the BFD session becomes Up, the configured interval is restored.\nAsynchronous mode: Detection period = Received Detect Mult of the remote system x Max (Local RMRI, Received DMTI)\nwhere"
