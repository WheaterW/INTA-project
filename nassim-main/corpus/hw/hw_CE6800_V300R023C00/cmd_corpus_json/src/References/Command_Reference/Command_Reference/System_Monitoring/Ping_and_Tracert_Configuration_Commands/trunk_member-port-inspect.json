    "ExtraInfo": "Multiple physical interfaces can be bundled into a logical interface, which is called a trunk interface. The physical interfaces are the trunk interface's member interfaces. If the ping command is run to test a trunk interface, the local device sends a ping packet to the remote device through a member interface. The remote device may select any member interface to send a reply packet back to the local device. When the quality of services carried on the trunk interface deteriorates greatly, users cannot determine which member interface of the trunk interface fails.\nThe trunk member-port-inspect command can be run on the receive side to ping each trunk member interface to monitor the status of the end-to-end link on each member interface. After the receive side receives a ping packet through the trunk interface, it uses the member interface directly connected to the transmit side to send a reply packet back, monitoring the status of the end-to-end link on a specified member interface and in turn determining the faulty trunk member interface. After this command is run to enable a device to monitor Layer 3 trunk member interfaces, ICMP echo reply packets are sent through the inbound interface of ICMP echo request packets."
