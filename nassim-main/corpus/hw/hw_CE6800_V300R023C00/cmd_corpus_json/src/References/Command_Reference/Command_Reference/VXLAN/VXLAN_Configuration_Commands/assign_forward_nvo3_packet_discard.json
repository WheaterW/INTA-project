    "FuncDef": "The assign forward nvo3 packet discard command configures a device to discard OSPF/OSPFv3 multicast packets received over a VXLAN tunnel.\nThe undo assign forward nvo3 packet discard command configures a device not to discard OSPF/OSPFv3 multicast packets received over a VXLAN tunnel. The assign forward nvo3 packet discard command configures a device to discard OSPF/OSPFv3 multicast packets received over a VXLAN tunnel. The undo assign forward nvo3 packet discard command configures a device not to discard OSPF/OSPFv3 multicast packets received over a VXLAN tunnel. By default, the device does not discard the OSPF/OSPFv3 multicast packets received from the tunnel, and the OSPF/OSPFv3 neighbor relationship can be established. This command is supported only on the CE6863H, CE6863H-K, CE6860-SAN, CE6866K, CE6866, CE6860-HAM, CE6855-48XS8CQ, CE6885-SAN, CE8850-SAN, CE8855, CE8851-32CQ4BQ, CE8851K, CE8851-32CQ8DQ-P, CE8850-HAM, CE6881H, CE6881H-K, CE6885, CE6885-T, CE6885-LL (standard forwarding mode) and CE6863E-48S8CQ.",
