    "ExtraInfo": "The command sets the maximum number of DHCP snooping binding entries (including both DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 binding entries) to be learned on an interface. If the number of DHCP snooping binding entries reaches the maximum value, subsequent users cannot access.\nWhen the number of entries in the DHCP snooping binding table on an interface reaches the maximum value set by the command, the DHCP snooping-enabled device fails to add entries to the binding table and sends a DHCP Release message to the DHCP server after receiving a DHCP ACK message.\nFor the system view configuration, the sum of the maximum numbers of DHCP snooping binding entries that can be learned by all interfaces is the configured maximum number. For the VLAN view configuration, the maximum number of DHCP snooping binding entries that can be learned by any interface in the VLAN is the configured maximum number. If the configuration is performed in the system, VLAN, and interface views, the maximum number of DHCP snooping binding entries that can be learned by the interface is the smallest value among the three views."
