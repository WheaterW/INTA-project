    "FuncDef": "The peer local-graceful-restart timer restart command sets the maximum duration for a device to wait for the BGP peer relationship with a specified peer to be reestablished. After this command is run, the device will not advertise the maximum duration to the specified peer.\nThe undo peer local-graceful-restart timer restart command deletes the configured duration. The peer local-graceful-restart timer restart command sets the maximum duration for a device to wait for the BGP peer relationship with a specified peer to be reestablished.
