    "ExtraInfo": "In the NFVI distributed gateway scenario where BGP EVPN peer relationships are established between L2GWs/L3GWs and DC-GWs, L2GWs or L3GWs learn MAC address and ND information through the data plane and advertise the information to DC-GWs through EVPN routes. This allows ND entries to be generated for Layer 2 forwarding and ensures that user services run properly. To enable a device to generate ND entries based on host information synchronized from EVPN routes, run the ipv6 nd generate-rd-table enable command."
