    "ExtraInfo": "In the VPN scenario, one VPN can communicate with another VPN if they have matching VPN targets, but VPNs cannot communicate with the public network. To enable a VPN to communicate with the public network, you have to ensure that the VPN and public network can obtain routes to each other. To import the VPN instance routes to public network, run the ip import-rib vpn-instance command.\nIn an intelligent traffic control scenario, traffic of different users are distributed to different VPNs. To enable public-network traffic to reach the VPNs, run the ip import-rib vpn-instance command to import routes in each VPN instance routing table to the public network routing table.\nTraffic forwarding relies on direct routes (Vlink direct routes) generated based on user entries. When VLAN tag termination sub-interfaces are used for route import between VPN and public network, Vlink direct routes cannot be imported. As a result, traffic forwarding is interrupted. To solve this problem, route import between VPN and public network newly supports import of Vlink direct routes.\nIn the IPv6 VPN networking, IPv6 users of two VPNs with matching VPN targets can communicate, but IPv6 VPN users cannot communicate with IPv6 public network users. To enable IPv6 VPN users to communicate with IPv6 public network users, you must configure IPv6 route import between VPN and public network instances. To enable a device to import IPv6 routes from a VPN instance to the public network instance, run the ipv6 import-rib vpn-instance command.\nTraffic forwarding relies on direct routes (Vlink direct routes) generated based on user entries.
