    "ExtraInfo": "In an ECMP scenario, when the primary link which takes over multicast traffic is down, the multicast traffic is switched over to a secondary ECMP link. After the primary link recovers, the multicast traffic is switched to the primary link. During a switchover, the multicast packets may be discarded or repeatedly sent. To address this issue, run the rpf ecmp non-reverse enable command, the traffic is not switched back to the primary link even if the primary link recovers.\nAfter the rpf ecmp non-reverse enable command is configured, traffic is not switched back to the primary link even if the recovered primary link has higher priority. Traffic will be switched back to the primary link only when the secondary link fails."
