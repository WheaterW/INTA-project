    "ExtraInfo": "PFC, also called Per Priority Pause or Class Based Flow Control (CBFC), enhances Ethernet Pause. Eight priority queues on the transmit interface of an upstream device correspond to eight buffers on the receive interface of a downstream device. When a receive buffer on the receive interface of the downstream device is to be congested, the downstream device sends a backpressure signal to the upstream device, requesting the upstream device to stop sending packets in the corresponding priority queue. This mechanism transmits backpressure signals level by level until reaching the source device.\nYou can run the priority command to specify a priority queue for which PFC is to be enabled, and then run the dcb pfc enable command to enable PFC on an interface.\nIf the command is run more than once, all configurations take effect."
