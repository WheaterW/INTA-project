    "ExtraInfo": "When a large number of BFD sessions flap, frequent link switchovers are performed. As a result, service forwarding is affected. If the undo bfd command is run to disable BFD to restore services, a large number of BFD configurations are lost. As a result, flapping fault locating becomes difficult. To resolve this issue, run the batch-shutdown command to shut down BFD sessions in batches.\nThe batch-shutdown command takes effect on static BFD sessions and static self-negotiated BFD sessions. This command issues the shutdown commands in a batch for these types of BFD sessions. A shutdown command instance is generated in the view of each BFD session."
