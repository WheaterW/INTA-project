Using the undo bfd trigger if-down command cancels the association between the BFD session status and the bound interface status. By default, a BFD session is not associated with the bound interface status.",

    "ExtraInfo": "After a fault on a physical interface is detected by BFD and rapidly removed, the BFD session goes Down, whereas the physical interface goes Up. This causes some traffic to fail to be switched and then discarded. To prevent packet loss, run the bfd trigger if-down command to trigger a transient interruption on the interface, which ensures that all traffic is rapidly switched."
