    "ExtraInfo": "On a network deployed with high-speed data services, if a fault occurs on a link, a large amount of data is lost because it takes a long time for RIP to detect the fault. Deploying BFD for RIP to accelerate fault detection is necessary.\nThe rip bfd static command is used to enable BFD for RIP on a specified link to rapidly detect the fault on the link. In addition, because a large number of devices do not support BFD, you can run this command to implement one-arm BFD detection independently."
