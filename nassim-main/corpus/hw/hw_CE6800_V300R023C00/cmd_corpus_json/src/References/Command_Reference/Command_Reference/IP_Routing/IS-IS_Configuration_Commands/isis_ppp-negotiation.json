    "ExtraInfo": "A reliable link layer protocol is required when IS-IS runs on a P2P link. In two-way handshake mode, once a device receives a Hello packet from its neighbor, the device declares the neighbor Up. In three-way handshake mode, a device declares its neighbor Up only when it knows that the neighbor also receives its packet. Compared with two-way handshake, three-way handshake can detect unidirectional link failures, improving the link reliability.\nThe isis ppp-negotiation command configures the link negotiation mode."
