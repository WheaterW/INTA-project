    "ExtraInfo": "After the distance-based headroom check function is enabled on an interface, the detection may fail if the link connected to this interface is faulty or congested. In this case, you can manually trigger the interface to send detection packets for distance-based headroom check. If the distance-based headroom check function is not enabled on the remote interface, the local interface cannot automatically complete detection even if it has the distance-based headroom check function enabled. Therefore, you are advised to manually trigger the interface to send detection packets after operations that may cause link status changes, such as interface initialization, interface rate switching, and interface split/aggregation."
