    "ExtraInfo": "To ensure that the device can obtain user parameters such as MAC addresses when generating DHCP snooping binding entries, DHCP snooping needs to be applied to the access device or the first DHCP relay agent on the Layer 2 network. Therefore, the GIADDR field in the DHCP messages received by the DHCP snooping-enabled device must be 0. If the GIADDR field is not 0, the DHCP messages are invalid and need to be discarded. This function is recommended when DHCP snooping is enabled on the DHCP relay agent. Generally, the GIADDR field in DHCP messages sent by a PC is 0. In some cases, the GIADDR field in DHCP messages sent by a PC is not 0, which may cause the DHCP server to allocate an incorrect IP address. To prevent PC users from forging DHCP messages with non-0 GIADDR field to apply for IP addresses, you are advised to configure this function."
