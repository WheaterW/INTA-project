    "ExtraInfo": "After IGMP snooping proxy or querier is enabled on a device in a Layer 2 broadcast domain, the device sends IGMP Query messages on behalf of the upstream Layer 3 router in the Layer 2 broadcast domain to collect user information. By default, the source IP address of the IGMP Query messages sent by the device is 192.168.0.1. In some scenarios, the IP address may be used by another device, or users require that the source IP address of IGMP Query messages be on the same network segment as the IP address of the local device. In this case, you can run the igmp-snooping send-query source-address command to set a source IP address for the IGMP Query messages sent by the device."
