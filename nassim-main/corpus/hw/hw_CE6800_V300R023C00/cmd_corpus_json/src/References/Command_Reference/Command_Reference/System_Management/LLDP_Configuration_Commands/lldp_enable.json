    "ExtraInfo": "LLDP is a Layer 2 discovery protocol defined in IEEE 802.1ab. LLDP enables the NMS to learn Layer 2 information about managed devices. The information includes names of interfaces used by one device to connect to other devices and connections between devices. LLDP enables the NMS to learn and analyze Layer 2 topology information. With LLDP, the NMS can manage networks of larger scales and obtain more specific information about network topology and interface changes.\nBefore you view the status of specific Layer 2 links between devices and analyze network topology, run the lldp enable command in the system view to enable LLDP globally."
