    "ExtraInfo": "BFD provides asynchronous detection mode. An auxiliary function of the mode is the echo function, which must work in this mode. When the echo function is activated, the local system sends a BFD control packet and the remote system loops back the packet through the forwarding channel. If several consecutive echo packets are not received, the session is declared to be Down.\nIf a device that supports the echo function is deployed on a network, you can run the echo-passive command to enable passive BFD echo for interworking with other vendors' devices."
