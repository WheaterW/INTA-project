If an error is found in configurations committed at rollback point B and the system must be rolled back, configuration rollback allows the system to roll back to the configurations at rollback point A. Additionally, configuration rollback point E is generated and specially marked with a Rollback flag, indicating that this point is generated because of configuration rollback.\nIf a configuration rollback error is detected, system configurations can be rolled back to what they were before the configuration rollback operation was performed and the new configuration rollback point is specially marked."
