    "ExtraInfo": "After a link group is configured, run the min-members command to configure the number of available member links that triggers a link cost adjustment in the link group. If the number of available member links in the link group falls below the configured min-num the link cost of these member links is increased. Consequently, the routes along the member links are not selected, and traffic is switched to a backup link, which prevents traffic loss."
