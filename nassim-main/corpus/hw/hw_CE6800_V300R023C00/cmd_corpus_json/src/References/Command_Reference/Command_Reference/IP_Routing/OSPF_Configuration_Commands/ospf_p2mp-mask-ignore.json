    "ExtraInfo": "OSPF checks the network masks carried in Hello packets. If the network mask carried in a received Hello packet is not the same as the network mask of the local device, the Hello packet is discarded.\nOn a P2MP network, when the mask lengths of devices are different, you can use the ospf p2mp-mask-ignore command to prevent the device from checking the network mask in Hello packets. In this manner, the OSPF neighbor relationship can be established."
