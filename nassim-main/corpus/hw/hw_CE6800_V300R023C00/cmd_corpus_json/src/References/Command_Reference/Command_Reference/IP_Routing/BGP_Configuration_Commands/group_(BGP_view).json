    "ExtraInfo": "A peer group consists of peers with the same routing policies. After a peer is added to a peer group, it inherits the configurations of this peer group. When the configurations of the peer group are changed, the configurations of these peers are changed accordingly.\nOn a large-scale BGP network, there are a large number of peers, many of which require the same policy. In such a case, you can run the group command to create a peer group, configure the policy for the peer group, and then add peers to the group, which simplifies configurations."
