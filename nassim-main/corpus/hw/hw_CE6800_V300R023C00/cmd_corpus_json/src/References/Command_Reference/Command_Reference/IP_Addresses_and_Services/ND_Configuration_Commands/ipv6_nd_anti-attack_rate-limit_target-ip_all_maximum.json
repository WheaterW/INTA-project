    "ExtraInfo": "If a device is attacked, it receives a large number of ND messages within a short period. As a result, the device consumes many CPU resources to learn and respond to ND entries, affecting the processing of other services. To resolve this issue, configure a rate limit for receiving ND messages based on any target IPv6 address. After the configuration is complete, the device counts the number of ND messages received per period based on any target IPv6 address. If the number of ND messages exceeds the configured limit, the device does not process excess ND messages."
