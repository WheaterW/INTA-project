The lsa-arrival-interval command sets the interval at which OSPFv3 LSAs are received. The undo lsa-arrival-interval command restores the default setting. By default, an intelligent timer is enabled. The maximum interval at which OSPFv3 LSAs are received is 1000 ms, the initial interval is 500 ms, and the Holdtime interval is 500 ms. This command is supported only on the CE6863H, CE6863H-K, CE6860-SAN, CE6866K, CE6866, CE6860-HAM, CE6855-48XS8CQ, CE6885-SAN, CE8850-SAN, CE8855, CE8851-32CQ4BQ, CE8851K, CE8851-32CQ8DQ-P, CE8850-HAM, CE6881H, CE6881H-K, CE6820H, CE6820H-K, CE6820S, CE6885, CE6885-T, CE6885-LL (standard forwarding mode) and CE6863E-48S8CQ.",

    "ExtraInfo": "To prevent excessive network resource consumption due to frequent network changes, you can run the lsa-arrival-interval command to configure an interval at which OSPFv3 LSAs are received.\nOn a stable network that requires fast route convergence, you can change the interval at which OSPFv3 LSAs are received to 0s. In this manner, the device can fast respond to topology or route changes, which speeds up route convergence."
