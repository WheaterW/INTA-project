You can run the ssh client key-exchange command to configure a key exchange algorithm list on the SSH client. The SSH server compares the configured key exchange algorithm list with the counterpart sent by the client and then selects the first matched key exchange algorithm for packet transmission. If the key exchange algorithm list sent by the client does not match any algorithm in the key exchange algorithm list configured on the server, the negotiation fails.\nThis command takes effect for both IPv4 and IPv6 SSH clients."
