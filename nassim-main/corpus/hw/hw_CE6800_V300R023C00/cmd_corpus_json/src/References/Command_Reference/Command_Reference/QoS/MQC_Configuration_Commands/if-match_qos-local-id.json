The if-match qos-local-id command configures a matching rule based on the local ID in a traffic classifier. The undo if-match qos-local-id command deletes a matching rule based on the local ID in a traffic classifier. By default, no matching rule based on the local ID is configured in a traffic classifier.

    "ExtraInfo": "You can run the remark qos-local-id command to configure the action of re-marking priorities of packets into the same QoS local ID in a traffic policy. Then, you can configure a traffic classifier that defines if-match qos-local-id in another traffic policy. This conserves ACL resources."
