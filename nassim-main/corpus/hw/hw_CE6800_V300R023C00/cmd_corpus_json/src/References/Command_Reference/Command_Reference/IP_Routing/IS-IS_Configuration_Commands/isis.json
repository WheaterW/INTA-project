    "ExtraInfo": "To configure other functions and features of IS-IS or IS-IS interfaces, you need to enable IS-IS first. You can enter the IS-IS view after the isis command is run.\nOn a large-scale network, if a large number of devices run IS-IS, there will be a huge number of routes, increasing maintenance costs, slowing down route convergence, and affecting network stability. To resolve the problem, you can run the isis command to start multiple processes to reduce the number of routes to be maintained.\nIn addition, to ensure that different services are forwarded properly on the network, you can run the isis command to start multiple IS-IS processes on one device to isolate these services."
