    "ExtraInfo": "The device manages users in domains. For example, AAA schemes and authorization information are bound to domains. During user authentication, the device assigns users to specified domains based on the domain names contained in user names. However, user names entered by many users on actual networks do not contain domain names. In this case, you can configure a default domain in an authentication profile. If users using this profile enter user names that do not contain domain names, the device manages the users in the default domain.\nOn actual networks, user names entered by some users contain domain names and those entered by other users do not. The device uses different domains to manage the users. Because authentication, authorization and accounting (AAA) information in the domains are different, users use different AAA information. To ensure that users using the same authentication profile use the same AAA information, you can configure a forcible domain in the authentication profile for the users. The device then manages the users in the forcible domain regardless of whether entered user names contain domain names or not."
