The encapsulate-ring-id enable command enables the function of encapsulating a ring network ID into the destination MAC address of ERPS packets. The undo encapsulate-ring-id enable command disables the function of encapsulating a ring network ID into the destination MAC address of ERPS packets. By default, the function of encapsulating a ring network ID into the destination MAC address of ERPS packets is disabled.

In this case, you need to run this command to enable the function of encapsulating a ring network ID into the destination MAC address of ERPS packets, so that the Huawei device can communicate with the non-Huawei device."
