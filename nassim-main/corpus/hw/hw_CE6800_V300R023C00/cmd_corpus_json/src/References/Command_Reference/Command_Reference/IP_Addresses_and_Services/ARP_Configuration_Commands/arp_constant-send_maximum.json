    "ExtraInfo": "After a device is enabled to send ARP packets at a constant rate, the device sends 5 ARP packets every 10 ms by default. To adjust the constant rate, run the arp constant-send maximum command. A proper constant rate can help prevent services from being affected on the peer device."
