    "ExtraInfo": "On an IS-IS network, when the local routing information changes, the device sends LSPs to advertise the change. If the local routing information changes frequently and new LSPs are generated immediately, a lot of system resources will be consumed. To prevent this problem, run the suppress-flapping lsp-generation command to configure a period for the router to delay generation of the same LSP during route flapping.\nThe flapping suppression process is as follows:"
