    "FuncDef": "The assign forward nvo3 disable command configures a device not to send OSPF/OSPFv3 multicast packets received through a VXLAN tunnel to the local device CPU for processing.\nThe undo assign forward nvo3 disable command configures a device to send OSPF or OSPFv3 multicast packets received through a VXLAN tunnel to the local device CPU for processing. The assign forward nvo3 disable command configures a device not to send OSPF/OSPFv3 multicast packets received through a VXLAN tunnel to the local device CPU for processing. The undo assign forward nvo3 disable command configures a device to send OSPF or OSPFv3 multicast packets received through a VXLAN tunnel to the local device CPU for processing. By default, a device forwards the OSPF/OSPFv3 multicast packets received from a tunnel to the local device for processing, and OSPF/OSPFv3 neighbor relationships can be established. This command is supported only on the CE6863H, CE6863H-K, CE6860-SAN, CE6866K, CE6866, CE6860-HAM, CE6855-48XS8CQ, CE6885-SAN, CE8850-SAN, CE8855, CE8851-32CQ4BQ, CE8851K, CE8851-32CQ8DQ-P, CE8850-HAM, CE6881H, CE6881H-K, CE6885, CE6885-T, CE6885-LL (standard forwarding mode) and CE6863E-48S8CQ.",
