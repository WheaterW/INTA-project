    "ExtraInfo": "Currently, BGP does not support dynamic capability negotiation. Therefore, BGP capability changes cause peer relationships to be re-established and routing entries to be deleted, interrupting services. To solve this problem, run the peer graceful-restart peer-reset command to reset the BGP connection with a specified peer in GR mode after GR is enabled on the BGP peer.\nAfter the function of resetting the BGP connection with a specified peer in GR mode is configured, if a BGP peer relationship in another address family is established based on the BGP IPv4 unicast peer session, BGP starts to reset the BGP connection with the specified peer in GR mode and renegotiates capabilities. During this process, the BGP IPv4 unicast peer session is re-established, but the original routing entries are not deleted. The forwarding module can still forward packets based on the routing information, ensuring uninterrupted IPv4 services."
