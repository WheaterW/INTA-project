    "ExtraInfo": "Generally, a routing table contains a large number of routes. To prevent excessive system resources from being consumed when a large number of routes are received from peers, you can run the peer route-limit command to set the maximum number of routes that a BGP device can receive from a peer. This provides a mechanism for controlling the routes received from peers in addition to distribution lists, filtering lists, and route mappings."
