    "ExtraInfo": "The TCP connection needs to be set up between the MSDP peers. MSDP requires the peer with the larger IP address to listen at the port 639, and the peer with the smaller IP address to start a connection. If the connection fails, the peer restarts the connection after a period of time. Such a period of time is called interval retrying to set up an MSDP peer relationship."
