    "ExtraInfo": "A BSR message carries information about all candidate-rendezvous points (C-RPs) on a network. If there are a large number of C-RPs, the length of a BSR message may exceed the maximum transmission unit (MTU) of an outbound interface. As a result, the BSR message cannot be processed, RP election fails, and multicast services cannot be transmitted normally. To resolve these problems, run the bsm semantic fragmentation command to enable BSR message fragmentation, so that the devices on the network can learn consistent RP information and MDTs can be successfully established.\nBSR message fragmentation is recommended because it can solve the problem faced by IP fragmentation that all fragments become unavailable due to loss of fragment information."
