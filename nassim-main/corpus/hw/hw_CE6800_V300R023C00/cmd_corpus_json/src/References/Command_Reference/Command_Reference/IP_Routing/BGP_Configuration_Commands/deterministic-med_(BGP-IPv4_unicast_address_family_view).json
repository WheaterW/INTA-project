    "ExtraInfo": "If the deterministic-med command is not run, routes are compared based on the sequence in which they are received. The sequence in which routes are received is related to the result of route selection.\nAfter the BGP deterministic-med function is enabled, when an optimal route is selected from the routes that are received from different ASs and have the same prefix, the routes are first grouped based on the leftmost AS number in the AS_Path. After the comparison in the group, the optimal route in the group is compared with the optimal route in another group. In this manner, the sequence in which routes are received is irrelevant to the result of route selection.\nFor detailed applications of this command, see Configuration - IP Routing - BGP Configuration - BGP Route Selection Rules - Route Attributes - MED."
