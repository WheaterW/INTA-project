    "ExtraInfo": "Multiple physical interfaces can be bound to an Eth-Trunk interface in a VLAN. If the per-link one-arm-echo parameter is not specified, the BFD session may go down as long as one physical interface goes down. As a result, the OSPF neighbor relationship goes down. If per-link one-arm-echo is specified, the BFD sessions goes down only when all physical interfaces are down. This ensures that OSPF neighbor relationships can be established."
