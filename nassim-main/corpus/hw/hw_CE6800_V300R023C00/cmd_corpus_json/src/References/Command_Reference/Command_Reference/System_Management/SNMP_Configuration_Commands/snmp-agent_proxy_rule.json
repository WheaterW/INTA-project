    "ExtraInfo": "The SNMP proxy and the Cabinet Control Unit (CCU) of a managed device are placed in the same outdoor cabinet. The SNMP proxy enables communication between the NMS and managed device and allows you to manage the configurations and system software version of the managed device. The NMS manages the SNMP proxy and managed device as an independent network element, reducing the number of managed network elements and management costs. The NMS monitors the performance of managed devices in real time, helping to improve service quality. After you run the snmp-agent proxy rule command to configure proxy rules, the SNMP proxy can automatically forward SNMP requests from the NMS to the managed device and forward responses from the managed device to the NMS."
