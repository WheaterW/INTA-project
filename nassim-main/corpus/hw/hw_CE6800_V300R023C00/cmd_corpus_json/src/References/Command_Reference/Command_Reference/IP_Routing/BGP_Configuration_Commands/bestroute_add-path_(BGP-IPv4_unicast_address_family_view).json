    "ExtraInfo": "In a scenario with an RR and clients, if the RR has multiple routes to the same destination (with the same prefix), the RR selects an optimal route from these routes and then sends only the optimal route to its clients. Therefore, the clients have only one route to the destination. If a link along this route fails, route convergence takes a long time, which cannot meet the requirements for high reliability. To address this issue, deploy the BGP Add-Path feature on the RR. With BGP Add-Path, the RR can send two or more routes with the same prefix to a specified peer. These routes can back up each other or load-balance traffic, which ensures high reliability in data transmission."
