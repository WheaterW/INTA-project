If the 4-byte private AS number capability is enabled, private AS numbers range from 64512 to 65534, and from 4200000000 to 4294967294. 65535 and 4294967295 are reserved for special use. If 4-byte private AS numbers are disabled, private AS numbers range from 64512 to 65534, and 65535 is reserved for special use.\nPublic AS numbers can be used over the Internet, whereas private AS numbers cannot be advertised to the Internet. If private AS numbers are advertised to the Internet, routing loops may occur. Therefore, private AS numbers are used only within a routing domain."
