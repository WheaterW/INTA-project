    "ExtraInfo": "This command applies to the scenarios that require fast authorization response. When a user in a user domain where multiple authorization modes (for example, HWTACACS authorization and local authorization) are configured, bypass authorization is enabled, and the bypass authorization timeout interval is configured, the user will be authorized using the local authorization mode and the bypass authorization timer is enabled simultaneously if the HWTACACS server does not respond to the authorization request. When other users in the same domain are authorized during the configured bypass authorization timeout interval, the users are directly authorized using the local authorization mode, so that the users can be authorized without waiting until the HWTACACS server responds to their authorization requests, accelerating the authorization response."
