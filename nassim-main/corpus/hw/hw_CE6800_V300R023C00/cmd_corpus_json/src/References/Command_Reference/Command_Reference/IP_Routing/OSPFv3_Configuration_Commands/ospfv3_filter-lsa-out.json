    "ExtraInfo": "In a scenario where a Huawei device interworks with a non-Huawei device, if the non-Huawei device receives unidentified packets and its processing behavior does not comply with the protocol, the neighbor relationship may fail to be established. OSPFv3 provides an escape method. You can run the ospfv3 filter-lsa-out command on an OSPFv3 interface to filter out LSAs that cannot be identified by non-Huawei devices in the outbound direction of the OSPFv3 interface. In this manner, the neighbor relationship can be quickly established."
