    "ExtraInfo": "If the peer session needs to be interrupted temporarily and a large number of configurations exist on the peer, you can run the peer ignore command to reduce the reconfiguration workload. For example, if the peer relationship is frequently established due to the upgrade or link adjustment of the peer end within a period of time, you can run this command on the stable end to temporarily interrupt the BGP peer relationship to prevent frequent route or peer relationship flapping.\nYou can run this command to terminate the session with a specified peer and clear all related routing information. For a peer group, this means that a large number of sessions with the peers are terminated suddenly."
