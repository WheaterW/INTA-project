    "ExtraInfo": "After the device sends a request packet to the HWTACACS server, if the device does not receive any response packet from the server within the specified response timeout interval:- If only one HWTACACS server is configured, the device does not retransmit the request to this server.- If both active/standby HWTACACS servers are available and the TCP link between them works normally, the device retransmits the request to the standby server after timeout. If the TCP link is broken during the timeout interval, the device immediately retransmits the request to the standby server.This improves reliability of HWTACACS authentication, authorization, and accounting.The default value is recommended."
