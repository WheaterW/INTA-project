    "ExtraInfo": "Without the PIM DR switching delay function, when the system triggers a PIM DR switchover, the switchover takes effect immediately, and therefore data forwarding will be interrupted during the switchover period. If the network is unstable, frequent switchovers occur, affecting the multicast forwarding performance. To address this issue, run the pim timer dr-switch-delay command to configure a PIM DR switching delay to implement non-stop service forwarding during the switchover."
