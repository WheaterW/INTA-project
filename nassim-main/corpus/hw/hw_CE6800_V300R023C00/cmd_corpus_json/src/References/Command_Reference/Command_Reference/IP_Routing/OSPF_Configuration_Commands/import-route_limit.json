    "ExtraInfo": "When OSPF imports a large number of external routes and advertises them to a device with a small route capacity, the number of routes learned by the device exceeds the route capacity. As a result, the device restarts unexpectedly. To prevent this problem, set a limit on the number of LSAs generated when an OSPF process imports external routes to ensure stable device operation. You can run the display ospf brief command to view the Current status field in the command output."
