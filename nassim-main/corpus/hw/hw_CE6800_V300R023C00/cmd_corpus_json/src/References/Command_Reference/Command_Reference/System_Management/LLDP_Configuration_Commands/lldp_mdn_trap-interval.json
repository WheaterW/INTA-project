    "ExtraInfo": "After the LLDP alarm function is enabled for a device, the device sends alarms to the NMS when MDN neighbor information changes. If MDN neighbor information changes frequently, the device frequently sends alarms to an NMS, causing network flapping.\nYou can run this command to set a delay for the device to send alarms about MDN neighbor information changes to the NMS. This command effectively prevents network flapping caused by alarms being frequently sent to the NMS."
