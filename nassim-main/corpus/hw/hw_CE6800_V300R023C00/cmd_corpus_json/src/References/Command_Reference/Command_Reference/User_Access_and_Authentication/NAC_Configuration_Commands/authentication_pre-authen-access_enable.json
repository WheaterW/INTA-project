The authentication pre-authen-access enable command enables the pre-connection function. The undo authentication pre-authen-access enable command disables the pre-connection function. By default, the pre-connection function is enabled. That is, if a user does not have any network access rights before being authenticated, the user is in the pre-connection state. This command is supported only on the CE6863H, CE6863H-K, CE6881H, CE6881H-K, CE6820H, CE6820H-K and CE6820S.",

    "ExtraInfo": "When a user terminal is connected to an NAC-enabled interface on the device, a pre-connection is established between the terminal and device. If the user fails the authentication, the device still sets the user to the pre-connection state by default. Because the device permits DHCP packets from pre-connection users, the users can still obtain IP addresses although they do not have any network access rights. This wastes IP addresses and brings network security risks.To prevent users from having certain network access rights before they are authenticated successfully, disable the pre-connection function. After the pre-connection function is disabled, users do not have network access rights before they are authenticated successfully and cannot obtain IP addresses.In pre-connection authorization scenarios, including authentication-free rules and pre-connection authorization, broadcast packets, multicast data packets and protocol packets such as ARP, ND, DHCP, and DHCPv6 packets are allowed to pass through.\nIn pre-connection scenarios without authorization, IP addresses cannot be obtained through DHCP by default.In policy association scenarios, protocol packets such as ARP, ND, DHCP, and DHCPv6 packets are allowed to pass through by default."
