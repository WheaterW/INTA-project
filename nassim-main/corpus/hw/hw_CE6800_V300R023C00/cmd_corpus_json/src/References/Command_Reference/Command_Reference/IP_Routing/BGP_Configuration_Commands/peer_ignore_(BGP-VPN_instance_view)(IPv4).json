    "ExtraInfo": "If a peer session needs to be interrupted temporarily and a large number of configurations exist on the peer, you can run the peer ignore command to reduce the reconfiguration workload. For example, if the peer relationship is frequently established because of the upgrade or link adjustment on the peer, you can run this command on the stabler end to prevent frequent route flapping or peer relationship.\nYou can run this command to terminate the session with a specified peer and clear all related routing information. In the case of a peer group, a large number of sessions are suddenly torn down."
