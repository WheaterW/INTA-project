    "ExtraInfo": "The ipv6 route recursive-lookup nd vlink-direct-route protocol static command is used in Layer 2 access to Layer 3 scenarios. It is used together with the recursive-lookup host-route parameter in the ipv6 route-static command to recurse IPv6 static routes only to ND Vlink direct routes.\nWhen a Layer 2 link fails, for example, the physical interface corresponding to a Layer 2 device fails, traffic can be quickly switched to the backup path to prevent black-hole routes."
