    "ExtraInfo": "As defined in LACP, active interfaces are selected according to the interface priority by default. If member interfaces of an Eth-Trunk interface in static LACP mode are of different rates, such as 100 Mbit/s and 1 Gbit/s, low-speed member interfaces may be selected as active interfaces because of their high priorities. If you intend to select high-speed interfaces to be active interfaces, you can run the lacp selected command to set the mode for selecting active interfaces to speed.\nIf you intend to select active interface according to the interface priority, you can run the lacp select priority command."
