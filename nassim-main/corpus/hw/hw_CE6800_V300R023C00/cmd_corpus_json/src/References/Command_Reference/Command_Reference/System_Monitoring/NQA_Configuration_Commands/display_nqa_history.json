NQA measures the performance of different protocols on the network, which allows carriers to collect the operation indicator of networks in real time.\nTo obtain history records of an NQA test instance, you can run the display nqa history command.\nThe display nqa history command helps you understand the network status by displaying the operation statistics about each test packet, including the status and round-trip delay."
