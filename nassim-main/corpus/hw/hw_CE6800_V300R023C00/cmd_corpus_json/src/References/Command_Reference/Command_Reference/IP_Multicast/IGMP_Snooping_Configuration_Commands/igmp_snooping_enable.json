    "ExtraInfo": "IGMP snooping runs on a Layer 2 device between a Layer 3 device and user hosts. The Layer 2 device listens to multicast protocol messages exchanged between the upstream Layer 3 device and user hosts to maintain multicast forwarding entries. In this manner, the Layer 2 device manages and controls forwarding of multicast data packets. Enabling IGMP snooping is the prerequisite for implementing Layer 2 multicast. To enable IGMP snooping, run the igmp-snooping enable command.\nThe differences between using this command in the system view and in the VLAN view are as follows:"
