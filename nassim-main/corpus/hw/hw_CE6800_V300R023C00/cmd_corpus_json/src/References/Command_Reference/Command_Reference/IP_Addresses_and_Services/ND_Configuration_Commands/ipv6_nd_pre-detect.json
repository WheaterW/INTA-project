    "ExtraInfo": "To enable a Router to send an NS message to detect the validity of ND entries before the ND entries change from the REACHABLE state to the STALE state, you can enable the pre-detection of ND entries. If the neighbor still exists, the ND entry status is REACHABLE; otherwise, the ND entry is deleted. In this manner, the forwarding plane no longer needs to frequently sense ND entry status changes. Instead, it considers all the existent entries as available to packet forwarding, thereby improving forwarding efficiency."
