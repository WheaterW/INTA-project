    "ExtraInfo": "To prevent malicious users from repeatedly sending captured data packets, the receiver discards duplicate or out-of-order data packets by default. In some cases, however, data packets are reordered during transmission because their sending priorities are different. As a result, the data packets are out of order when they reach the receiver. To ensure that these out-of-order data packets can be received normally, configure the replay protection window size."
