    "ExtraInfo": "When generating the system LSP, a device fills in the maximum Keepalive time for this LSP. When other devices receive this LSP, the Keepalive time of the LSP is reduced continuously. If a device does not receive the update LSP, the Keepalive time of the LSP is reduced to 0, the LSP is kept for 60 seconds. If a new LSP is not received in 60 seconds, the device deletes the LSP.\nThe timer lsp-max-age command can adjust the maximum Keepalive time of an LSP to ensure the validity of old LSPs before the refreshed LSPs are received."
