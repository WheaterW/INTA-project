    "ExtraInfo": "In the EVC model, after receiving packets, the member interfaces of a BD broadcast these packets in the BD. To reduce broadcast traffic, network administrators usually run the isolate enable command in a BD where users do not need to communicate with each other. After this command is run, users on different access interfaces in the BD are isolated and cannot communicate with each other at Layer 2. However, as services become more diverse and keep increasing, users have growing needs for intra-BD communication. To allow isolated users in a BD to communicate, configure local proxy ARP on the VBDIF interface of the BD."
