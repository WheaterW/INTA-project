The mka cak-mode static command configures a static Connectivity Association Key Name (CKN) and a Connectivity Association Key (CAK). The undo mka cak-mode static command deletes the configured static CKN and CAK. By default, no static CKN or CAK is configured.

It must contain at least one digit (0 to 9) and one case-insensitive letter (A to F). The letters are case insensitive and different from ckn. The value can also be a string of 148 to 188 characters in ciphertext, the start and end characters of the ciphertext must be set to %@ %# or %+ %#, and the ciphertext is saved in %+ %# format.\nThe maximum length is recommended. If the configured CAK is shorter than the maximum length, the device adds 0s to the end of the CAK to reach the maximum length. If the CAKs configured on both ends are the same from the first character to the last non-zero character, the two CAKs are considered the same."
