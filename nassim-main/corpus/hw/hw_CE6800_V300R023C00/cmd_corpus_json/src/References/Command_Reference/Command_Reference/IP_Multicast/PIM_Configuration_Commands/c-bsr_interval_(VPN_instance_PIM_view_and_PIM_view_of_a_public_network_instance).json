    "ExtraInfo": "To maintain the BSR status, a BSR dynamically elected among candidate-bootstrap routers (C-BSRs) needs to periodically send bootstrap messages carrying the BSR IP address and the rendezvous point (RP)-set information to the C-BSRs. To set the interval (called BS_interval) at which the BSR sends bootstrap messages, run the c-bsr interval command.\nOnly the BSR sends bootstrap messages, and each C-BSR starts a timer and waits to receive bootstrap messages from the BSR before the timer times out. The timeout period (called holdtime) of the timer can be configured using the c-bsr holdtime command."
