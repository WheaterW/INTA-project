The assign forward any-flow resource command sets the hardware flow table resource allocation mode. The undo assign forward any-flow resource command deletes the hardware flow table resource allocation mode. By default, the hardware flow table resource allocation mode is standard, that is, half of the hardware flow table resources are allocated to IPv4 traffic and the other half are allocated to IPv6 traffic. This command is supported only on the CE6860-SAN, CE6866K, CE6866, CE6860-HAM, CE8850-SAN, CE8851K, CE8851-32CQ8DQ-P and CE8850-HAM.",

    "ExtraInfo": "After the AnyFlow function is enabled, the device collects traffic and generates flow entries in the hardware flow table. By default, IPv4 and IPv6 traffic each occupies half of the hardware storage space. If only IPv4 or IPv6 traffic is transmitted on the live network, you can run the assign forward any-flow resource command to adjust the allocation of hardware flow table resources."
