    "ExtraInfo": "A VRRP backup group can be used to implement gateway redundancy without causing networking changes. The VRRP backup group uses the master device to forward traffic along an active link. One virtual IP address serves one separate user group, in which users have the same reliability requirements. This setting helps prevent the default gateway addresses from varying according to location changes of VRRP routers. A maximum of 16 virtual IP addresses can be configured for each VRRP group.\nA VRRP backup group works in either master/backup or load balancing mode."
