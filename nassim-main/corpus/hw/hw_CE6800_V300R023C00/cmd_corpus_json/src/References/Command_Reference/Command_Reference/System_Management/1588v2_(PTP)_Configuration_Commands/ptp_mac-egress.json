    "FuncDef": "The ptp mac-egress command configures MAC encapsulation for PTP packets (excluding transparently transmitted packets) to be sent from an interface. The undo ptp mac-egress command restores the default configuration of MAC encapsulation on an interface. By default, MAC encapsulation in multicast mode is used, with the priority value of 7 and no VLAN ID carried.
