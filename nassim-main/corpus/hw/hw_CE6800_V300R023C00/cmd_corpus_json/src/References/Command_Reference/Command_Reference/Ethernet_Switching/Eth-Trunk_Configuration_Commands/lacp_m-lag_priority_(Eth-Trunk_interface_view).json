    "ExtraInfo": "When an M-LAG consists of Eth-Trunk interfaces working in LACP mode, each member Eth-Trunk interface and the connected peer Eth-Trunk interface use LACP M-LAG system priorities to determine the priority of the device at either end of the Eth-Trunk link. The device with the higher priority functions as the LACP Actor and determines which member interfaces in its Eth-Trunk interface are active based on the interface priorities. The other device selects the member interfaces connected to the active member interfaces on the Actor as active member interfaces."
