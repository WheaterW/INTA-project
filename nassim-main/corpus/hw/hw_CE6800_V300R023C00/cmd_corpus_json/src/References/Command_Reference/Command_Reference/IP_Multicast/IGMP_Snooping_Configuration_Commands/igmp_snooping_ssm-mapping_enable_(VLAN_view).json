    "ExtraInfo": "To provide SSM services for old-fashioned multicast terminals that support only IGMPv1 or IGMPv2, configure SSM mapping on the terminals. The SSM mapping mechanism is used to convert IGMPv1 and IGMPv2 Report messages into messages with (S, G) information. It allows hosts which do not support IGMPv3 to work with SSM-enabled devices.\nThe igmp snooping ssm-mapping enable command enables SSM mapping in a VLAN. If policy is configured in the command, an SSM mapping policy can be specified for the VLAN."
