    "ExtraInfo": "When a device learns MAC addresses and adds MAC address entries to a MAC address table, the device cannot identify whether packets are from authorized users or hackers, which brings security threats. If hackers spoof authorized users by changing the source MAC address of packets and access a device through different interfaces from authorized users' access interfaces, the device learns incorrect MAC address entries. As a result, the packets that should be forwarded to authorized users are forwarded to hackers.\nTo improve interface security, run the mac-address static bridge-domain command to add a specified user MAC address to a MAC address table so that a user device is bound to a local device interface, which prevents hackers from accessing the local device and obtaining data."
