The ipv6 nd anti-attack rate-limit source-mac all maximum command configures a rate limit for sending ND messages to the CPU based on any source MAC address, that is, the number of ND messages that can be processed per second based on any source MAC address.

    "ExtraInfo": "If a device is attacked, it receives a large number of ND messages within a short period. As a result, the device consumes many CPU resources to learn and respond to peer entries, affecting processing of other services. To resolve this issue, configure a rate limit for sending ND messages to the CPU based on any source MAC address. After the configuration is complete, the device counts the number of ND messages received per period based on any source MAC address. If the number of ND messages exceeds the configured limit, the device does not process excess ND messages."
