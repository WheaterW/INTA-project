    "ExtraInfo": "A large number of packets including malicious attack packets are sent to the CPU on a network. If excess packets are sent to the CPU, the CPU usage becomes high and CPU performance deteriorates. The attack packets affect services and may even cause system breakdown. To solve the problem, create an attack defense policy and configure CPU attack defense and attack source tracing in the attack defense policy."
