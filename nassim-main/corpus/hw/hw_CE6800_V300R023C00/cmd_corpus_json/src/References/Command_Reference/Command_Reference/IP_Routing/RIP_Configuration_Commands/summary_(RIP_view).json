    "ExtraInfo": "On a large RIP network, a large routing table occupies a large number of memory resources for storage and a large number of network resources for transmission and processing. RIP-2 classful summarization can address this problem. Classful route summarization allows multiple routes with the same IP prefix and destination IP address to be summarized into one, which reduces the number of routing entries and improves scalability and efficiency of large-scale networks.\nIf poison reverse has been enabled using the rip poison-reverse command or split horizon has been enabled using the rip split-horizon command, the default classful summarization function does not take effect. In this situation, run the summary always command to re-enable this function."
