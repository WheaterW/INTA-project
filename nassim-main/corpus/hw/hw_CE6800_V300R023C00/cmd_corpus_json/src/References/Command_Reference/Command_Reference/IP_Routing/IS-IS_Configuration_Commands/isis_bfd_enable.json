It can work with IS-IS to fast detect faults on neighboring devices and instruct IS-IS to recalculate routes for correct packet forwarding. The isis bfd command can be used to set BFD session parameters on a specified interface. The isis bfd enable command can be used to enable BFD on a specified interface and establish a BFD session with default parameter values."
