    "ExtraInfo": "Ethernet OAM fault advertisement is implemented by an OAM manager (OAMMGR), application modules, and detection modules. An OAMMGR module associates one module with another. A detection module monitors link status and network performance. If a detection module detects a fault, it instructs the OAMMGR module to notify an application module or another detection module of the fault. After receiving the notification, the application or detection module takes measures to prevent a communication interruption or service quality deterioration."
