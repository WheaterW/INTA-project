The preference command sets a priority for EBGP routes, IBGP routes, or local BGP routes. BGP routes are configured with different priorities in different address family views. The undo preference command restores the default setting. By default, the priorities of EBGP routes, IBGP routes, and local BGP routes are all 255.

The routes that do not meet the rules use the default priority.\nThe smaller the priority value, the higher the priority."
