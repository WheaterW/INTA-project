The traffic-analysis enable command creates an action for enabling intelligent traffic analysis in a traffic behavior. The undo traffic-analysis enable command deletes the action of enabling intelligent traffic analysis in a traffic behavior. By default, no action of enabling intelligent traffic analysis is configured in a traffic behavior. This command is supported only on the CE6860-SAN, CE6866K, CE6866, CE6860-HAM, CE8850-SAN, CE6885-LL (low latency mode), CE8851K, CE8851-32CQ8DQ-P and CE8850-HAM.",

    "ExtraInfo": "The UDP intelligent traffic analysis module of a device matches UDP traffic passing through the inbound interface based on ACL rules. Only common IPv4 UDP packets or inner IPv4 UDP packets encapsulated in IPv4 VXLAN packets can be matched. Matched traffic is sent to The TAP for analysis based on the block granularity.The TCP intelligent traffic analysis module of a device matches TCP traffic passing through the inbound interface based on ACL rules and creates an intelligent traffic analysis flow table for in-depth analysis of matched traffic to obtain high-precision information such as the packet loss rate, delay, and traffic volume."
