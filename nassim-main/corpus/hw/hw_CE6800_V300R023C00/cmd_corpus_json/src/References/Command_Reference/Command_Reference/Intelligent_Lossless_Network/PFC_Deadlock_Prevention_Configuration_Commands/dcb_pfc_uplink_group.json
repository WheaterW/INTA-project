    "ExtraInfo": "PFC deadlock prevention is a preventive solution. This function enables devices to identify service flows that may cause a PFC deadlock, modify the queue priority, and change the PFC backpressure path to prevent loops caused by PFC frames.\nA PFC uplink interface group is defined in the PFC deadlock prevention function. You can add a leaf node's interfaces connecting to a spine node to a PFC uplink interface group. If the system detects that a service flow enters and exits through interfaces in the interface group, the service flow is a high-risk hook-shaped flow that may cause a PFC deadlock."
