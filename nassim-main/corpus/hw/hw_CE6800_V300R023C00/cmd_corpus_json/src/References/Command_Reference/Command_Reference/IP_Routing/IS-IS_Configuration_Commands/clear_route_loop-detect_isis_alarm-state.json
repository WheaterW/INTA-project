    "ExtraInfo": "After detecting an IS-IS routing loop, a device reports an alarm. The device cannot automatically detect whether the loop is rectified. After detecting and rectifying the loop, you need to run this command to disable the device from advertising a large link cost for imported routes and manually clear the IS-IS loop alarm. If this command is executed when the routing loop problem is not resolved, the alarm is reported again."
