    "ExtraInfo": "The SNMP agent is an agent running on network devices. By default, the SNMP agent manages devices by monitoring port 161 on a device and responding to messages sent by the NMS. As the port number monitored is fixed, this brings security risks. For example, all attack packets may be sent to this port, which causes a network congestion.\nTo improve device security, run the snmp-agent udp-port command to change the port number monitored by the SNMP agent."
