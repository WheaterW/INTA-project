    "ExtraInfo": "If the ibgp-interface-sensitive command is not run and a local interface on which a direct IBGP peer relationship is established fails, the system deletes the IBGP peer relationship only when the hold timer expires, which delays route switching. To address this problem, run the ibgp-interface-sensitive command to enable BGP to delete the direct IBGP peer relationship established on a local interface upon a failure of the interface."
