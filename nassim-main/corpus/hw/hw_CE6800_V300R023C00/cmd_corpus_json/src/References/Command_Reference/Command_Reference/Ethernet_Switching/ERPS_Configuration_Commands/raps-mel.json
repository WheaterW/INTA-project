    "ExtraInfo": "On a Layer 2 network where ERPS is running, if another fault detection protocol is enabled, the MEL field in R-APS PDUs determines whether the R-APS PDUs can be forwarded. If the MEL value in an ERPS ring is smaller than the MEL value of the fault detection protocol, the R-APS PDUs have a lower priority and are discarded. If the MEL value in an ERPS ring is larger than the MEL value of the fault detection protocol, the R-APS PDUs can be forwarded. You can run the raps-mel command to set the value of the MEL field in R-APS PDUs.\nIn addition, the MEL value can also be used for interworking with other vendors' devices in an ERPS ring. The same MEL value ensures smooth communication between devices."
