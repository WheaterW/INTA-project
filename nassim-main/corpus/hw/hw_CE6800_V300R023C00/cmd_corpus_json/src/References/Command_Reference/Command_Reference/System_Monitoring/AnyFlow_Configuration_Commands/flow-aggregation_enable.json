    "ExtraInfo": "After the AnyFlow function is enabled on a device, the device exports original flow statistics by default. That is, the device sends the statistics about each flow to the analyzer. Original flow statistics export occupies much network bandwidth. To reduce bandwidth consumption, you can configure aggregation flow statistics export. The device aggregates flows with a specified port number based on aggregation keywords including the source IP address, destination IP address, destination port number, and protocol type."
