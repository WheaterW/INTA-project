    "ExtraInfo": "When unauthorized users send a large number of ARP packets to attack a device, the device wastes a large number of resources in processing ARP packets, affecting the processing of other services. To solve this problem, you can configure the device to limit the rate of ARP packets so that the device can process a specified number of ARP packets within a specified period. This prevents a large number of resources from being wasted in processing ARP packets and ensures normal service running."
