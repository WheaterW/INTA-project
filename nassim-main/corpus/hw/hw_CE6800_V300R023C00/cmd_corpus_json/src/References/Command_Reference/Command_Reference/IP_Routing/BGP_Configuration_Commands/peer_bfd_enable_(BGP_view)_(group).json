    "ExtraInfo": "BGP uses BFD to quickly detect faults in links between BGP peers. This accelerates network convergence. You can run this command to create a BFD session with default detection parameters for a peer or peer group.\nIf single-hop-prefer is specified, single-hop detection is preferentially used when a BFD session is established between BGP peers. This parameter is used to detect IP connectivity between BGP peers. That is, only one BFD session exists on a specified BGP interface. This parameter is used to ensure that the local and peer ends use the same detection mode when a Huawei device is connected to a non-Huawei device.\nThe per-link one-arm-echo parameter enables one-arm BFD echo for each link. This parameter ensures that the local and peer ends use the same detection mode when a Huawei device is connected to a non-Huawei device.\nAfter a peer is added to a peer group, the peer inherits the BFD configuration of the peer group regardless of whether BFD is enabled on the peer. If the peer does not need to inherit the configuration of the peer group, run the peer bfd block command on the peer to prevent the peer from inheriting the BFD function of the peer group.\nIf neither single-hop-prefer nor compatible is specified, the multi-hop mode is used by default when a BFD session is established between BGP peers, and the TTL value in BFD packets is 253 by default."
