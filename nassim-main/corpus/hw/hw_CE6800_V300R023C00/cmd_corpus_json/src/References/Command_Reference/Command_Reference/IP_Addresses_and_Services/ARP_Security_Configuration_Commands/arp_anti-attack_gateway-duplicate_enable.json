    "ExtraInfo": "If an attacker functions as a bogus gateway by sending ARP packets with the source IP address as the gateway IP address on a LAN, other devices on the LAN may record incorrect gateway address mappings in the ARP table. As a result, the traffic that is supposed to be sent to the gateway will be transmitted to the attacker. The attacker can then easily obtain the data content, and these devices will eventually fail to access the network.\nTo defend against bogus gateways, you can run this command to enable the ARP bogus gateway attack defense function on the gateway directly connected to a user host. For the following conditions:"
