    "ExtraInfo": "In most cases, to check information about IS-IS neighbors and LSDBs on an IS-IS device, you need to use a system ID of a 12-digit hexadecimal number, for example, aaaa.eeee.1234. This representation, however, is complicated and not easy to use. The dynamic hostname mapping mechanism is introduced to facilitate maintenance and management of IS-IS networks. The is-name command is used to configure a simple hostname for a local device and enables the device to advertise it in an LSP.\nAfter the configuration is completed, you can run the display isis name-table command to check the configured hostname."
