    "ExtraInfo": "If an OSPFv3 network requires high security, you can configure GTSM to improve network security. GTSM defends against attacks through TTL detection. If an attacker continuously sends simulated OSPFv3 unicast packets to a device, the device directly sends the packets to OSPFv3 on the control plane after receiving them, without checking the validity of these packets. As a result, the control plane of the device is busy processing these packets, and the CPU usage is high. GTSM protects a device by checking whether the TTL value in the IP packet header is within a pre-defined range to enhance system security.\nThe ospfv3 valid-ttl-hops command enables OSPFv3 GTSM. To check the TTL values of the packets that match the GTSM policy, you need to specify vpn-instance in the command.\nFor example, if you run the ospfv3 valid-ttl-hops command, OSPFv3 GTSM is enabled on both the public network and VPNs. If the ospfv3 valid-ttl-hops 5 vpn-instance command is run, OSPFv3 GTSM is enabled on both the public network and VPNs, the TTL values of OSPFv3 packets in the specified VPN instance are checked, and the default action is taken on the OSPFv3 packets that do not match GTSM policies in the public network and other VPN instances."
