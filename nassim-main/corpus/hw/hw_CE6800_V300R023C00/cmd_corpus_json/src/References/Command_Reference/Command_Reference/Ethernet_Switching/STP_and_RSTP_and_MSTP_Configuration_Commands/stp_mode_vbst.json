The stp mode vbst command sets an operation mode vbst for a spanning tree protocol. The undo stp mode command restores the default operation mode of a spanning tree protocol. By default, the operation mode of a spanning tree protocol is MSTP.",

    "ExtraInfo": "On the network running a spanning tree protocol, devices running different spanning tree protocols cannot communicate with each other. As a result, spanning trees cannot be properly calculated. A switch has four operation modes: VBST, MSTP, RSTP, and STP.\nThe stp mode command can be used to set a proper operation mode for a spanning tree protocol on a device and enables the device to identify BPDUs sent by a device that runs a different spanning tree protocol during communication."
