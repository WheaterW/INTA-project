    "ExtraInfo": "V-STP is a Layer 2 topology management feature in the M-LAG solution. V-STP allows two devices that both have STP enabled to be virtualized into one device to perform STP calculation.\nSTP can detect the M-LAG master/backup negotiation status. After the negotiation is complete and V-STP is enabled on the master and backup devices, the two devices are virtualized into one device to calculate roles and rapid convergence. To ensure correct STP calculation, the M-LAG backup device synchronizes the bridge MAC address and instance priority from the master device."
