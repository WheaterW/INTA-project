    "FuncDef": "The bandwidth-config enable command enables a device to use the configuration bandwidth of each OSPF interface to calculate the cost for the interface.\nThe undo bandwidth-config enable command disables a device from using the configuration bandwidth of each OSPF interface to calculate the cost for the interface. The bandwidth-config enable command enables a device to use the configuration bandwidth of each OSPF interface to calculate the cost for the interface. The undo bandwidth-config enable command disables a device from using the configuration bandwidth of each OSPF interface to calculate the cost for the interface. By default, the configuration bandwidth of an OSPF interface is not used in cost calculation for the interface.",

    "ExtraInfo": "External factors may affect the physical bandwidth of links and change the physical bandwidth of interfaces, which in turn affects network performance. To configure a device to adjust and optimize route selection rules, you can run the bandwidth command in the interface view to set configuration bandwidth for the interface, and then run the bandwidth-config enable command to enable the device to calculate the cost for the interface based on the configuration bandwidth of the interface."
