    "ExtraInfo": "The Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol protects data privacy on the Internet by preventing attackers from eavesdropping on data exchanged between a client and a server. Specifically, to ensure data transmission security on a network, a peer group needs to be configured as an SSL client using the peer ssl-policy role client command or as a server using the peer ssl-policy role server command, and the SSL data encryption, identity authentication, and message integrity verification mechanisms need to be used."
