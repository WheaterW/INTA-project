    "ExtraInfo": "By default, when an EBGP peer receives the same VPN ORF route from multiple peers, the EBGP peer selects one route from the multiple VPN ORF routes with the same prefix as the preferred route and advertises only the VPN ORF route to the preferred peer. As a result, fast reroute (FRR) and load balancing cannot be implemented.\nTo implement FRR and load balancing between ASBRs, run the external-path command to set the maximum number of EBGP peers in the BGP-VPN-Target address family to increase the number of VPN routes that match the VPN targets advertised by the peers."
