    "ExtraInfo": "To adapt to changes in the external environment, you can run this command to manually adjust the temperature alarm threshold so that the system can detect board temperature changes more accurately and quickly.\n\nWhen the fan works in automatic speed adjustment mode, the fan speed can be automatically adjusted according to the board temperature. The adjustment policy varies according to the hardware. The main policies are as follows:\nSpeed adjustment policy 1:\nWhen the temperature is greater than or equal to tmax-value, the fan speed increases.When the temperature is lower than tmax-value-2, the fan speed decreases.\nSpeed adjustment policy 2:\nWhen the temperature is lower than or equal to tmin-value, the fan speed decreases to the lower limit.When the temperature is higher than tmin-value, the fan speed increases with the temperature.When the temperature reaches tmax-value, the fan speed is adjusted to 100%."
