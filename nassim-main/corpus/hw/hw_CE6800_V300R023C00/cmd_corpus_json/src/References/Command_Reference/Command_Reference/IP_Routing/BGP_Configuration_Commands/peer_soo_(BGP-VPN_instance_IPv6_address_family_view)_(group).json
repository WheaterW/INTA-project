    "ExtraInfo": "In an L3VPN scenario, if the ASs where two VPN sites reside use private AS numbers, the AS numbers of the two VPN sites may be the same. As a result, different sites in the same VPN cannot communicate with each other. In this case, you need to run the peer substitute-as command on the PE to enable AS number substitution.\nHowever, enabling AS number substitution causes another problem. When multiple CEs at a VPN site access different PEs on the L3VPN backbone network through BGP and routing protocols are deployed between the CEs, if AS number substitution is configured on the PEs, the AS numbers of the VPN routes at the VPN site will be replaced on the PEs. In this case, the routes may be sent back to the VPN site through the backbone network and other CEs. As a result, a routing loop occurs. To solve this problem, run the peer soo command on the PEs to configure the SoO feature for the specified CE.\nAfter this command is run on a PE, the PE adds the SoO attribute to the routes received from a CE and advertises the routes to other PE peers. When advertising these routes to the connected CE, the other PE peers check the SoO attribute carried in the VPN routes. If the SoO attribute is the same as the locally configured SoO attribute, the PEs do not advertise the routes to the CE. This prevents routing loops in the VPN site."
