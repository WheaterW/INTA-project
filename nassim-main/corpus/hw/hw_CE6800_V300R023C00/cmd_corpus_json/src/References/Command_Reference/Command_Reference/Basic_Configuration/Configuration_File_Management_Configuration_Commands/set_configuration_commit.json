The rollback point ID is an integer that ranges from 1000000001 to 1999999999, which is difficult to understand and remember. When the number of configuration rollback points that are automatically generated by the system reaches the upper threshold, earliest configuration rollback points are replaced by latest configuration rollback points. For some important configurations, however, the related configuration rollback points need to be retained. In this case, you can run the set configuration commit command to specify a user label for a configuration rollback point, which is easy to understand and remember and ensures that configuration rollback points related to important configurations are not replaced.You can specify a user label when you run the commit command to generate a rollback point. After a rollback point is generated, you can run the set configuration commit label command to set a user label for the rollback point. For continuous configuration rollback points with labels, you cannot directly modify the labels. You must run the clear configuration commit label command to delete the labels of the configuration rollback points first and then run the set configuration commit label command to specify user labels for the configuration rollback points.You can run the clear configuration commit label command to delete the configured labels. After a configuration rollback point is deleted, its label is deleted accordingly."
