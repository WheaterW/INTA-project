The if-match inner-8021p command configures a matching rule based on the 802.1p priority in the inner tag of QinQ packets in a traffic classifier. The undo if-match inner-8021p command deletes a matching rule based on the 802.1p priority in the inner tag of QinQ packets in a traffic classifier. By default, a matching rule based on the 802.1p priority in the inner tag of QinQ packets is not configured in a traffic classifier.
