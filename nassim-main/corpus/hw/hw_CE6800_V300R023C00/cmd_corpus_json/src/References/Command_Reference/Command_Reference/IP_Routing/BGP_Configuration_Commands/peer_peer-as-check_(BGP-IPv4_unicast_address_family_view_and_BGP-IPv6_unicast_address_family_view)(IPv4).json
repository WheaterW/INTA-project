    "ExtraInfo": "By default, after receiving a route from an EBGP peer in AS 200, the local device in AS 100 advertises the route to all EBGP peers in AS 200. After the peer peer-as-check command is run, the local device does not advertise the routes received from an EBGP peer to other EBGP peers in the same AS with this EBGP peer. This reduces BGP memory and CPU consumption and shortens route convergence time during route flapping."
