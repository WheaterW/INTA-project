    "ExtraInfo": "When the existing license file that has been activated is about to expire, apply for and activate a new license file or upgrade the existing license file. Otherwise, the expiring license becomes invalid upon expiration. As a result, function modules are shut down and services are interrupted. To prevent services from being affected, apply for a new license and activate it before the license expires. The license revocation code is the evidence for license invalidation and is used to apply for a new license.\nTo check revocation code of the invalid license file on the device, run the display license revoke-ticket command."
