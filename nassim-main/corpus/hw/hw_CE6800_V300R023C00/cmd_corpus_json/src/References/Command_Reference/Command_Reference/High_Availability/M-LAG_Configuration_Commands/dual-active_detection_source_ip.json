    "ExtraInfo": "When a CE is dual-homed to two PEs on an Ethernet, VXLAN, or IP network, to enable PEs to exchange heartbeat packets, DFS groups need to be bound to IP addresses of Layer 3 interfaces connecting the two PEs. If the CE connects to a VPN, you must specify the VPN instance bound to the DFS group.\nAssume that the heartbeat IP address and UDP port number of the peer device are specified when the heartbeat IP address bound to a DFS group is configured. When the configuration takes effect, the two M-LAG devices immediately start to send and receive heartbeat packets and negotiate the HB DFS master/backup status. In scenarios where enhanced DAD for secondary faults is enabled, if faults on the original DFS master device are rectified and the peer-link fault persists, the corresponding interfaces on the backup device are triggered to enter the Error-Down state based on the HB DFS master/backup status. This mechanism prevents abnormal traffic forwarding in the scenario where two master devices exist and improves device reliability."
