    "ExtraInfo": "In keychain authentication mode, secure protocol packet transmission is provided by changing the authentication algorithm and key dynamically. This can prevent unauthorized users from obtaining the key, and authentication and encryption algorithms, and reduce the workload of changing the algorithm and key manually.\nEach keychain consists of multiple key IDs that are valid within different time periods and each key ID is configured with an authentication algorithm. When a key ID becomes valid, the corresponding authentication algorithm is used.\nWhen configuring an authentication algorithm, configure a key for protocol packet authentication."
