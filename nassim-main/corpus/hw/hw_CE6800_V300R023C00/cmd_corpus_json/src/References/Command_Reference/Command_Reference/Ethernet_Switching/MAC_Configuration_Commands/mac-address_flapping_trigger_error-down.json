    "ExtraInfo": "If MAC address flapping occurs on a user network due to a ring network and the network does not support loop prevention protocols, you can configure an action to be taken on the corresponding interface to prevent loops. After an action is configured on an interface, the system shuts down the interface when detecting MAC address flapping on the interface."
