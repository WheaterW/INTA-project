    "ExtraInfo": "An SCI identifies the source of a packet. It consists of the MAC address of an interface and the last two bytes of the interface index. When the device is connected to a non-Huawei device and MACsec is configured on them, the MACsec frame header may need to contain the SCI to identify the source of packets because the implementation of MACsec on the device is different from that on the non-Huawei device. Currently, the device supports only device-to-device MACsec. The two MACsec-enabled interfaces on both devices only establish a session with each other. In this case, the MACsec frame header does not need to contain an SCI."
