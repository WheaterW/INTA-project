The peer route-update-interval command sets the interval for sending Update messages with the same route prefix to a peer. The undo peer route-update-interval command restores the default configuration. By default, the interval at which routing updates are sent to IBGP peers is 15s, and the interval at which routing updates are sent to EBGP peers is 30s.

    "ExtraInfo": "When routes change, the device sends routing updates to notify its peers. If a route changes frequently, the peer route-update-interval command can be used to adjust the interval at which Update packets are sent for changes of this route. This frees the device from sending Update packets for every route change."
