The ospf advertise max-cost command configures a device to change the costs of all its OSPF LSAs to be advertised to the maximum value. The undo ospf advertise max-cost command cancels this configuration. By default, a device does not change the cost of any of its OSPF LSAs to be advertised to the maximum value.

    "ExtraInfo": "In an M-LAG scenario where an M-LAG member device needs to be maintained, run the ospf advertise max-cost command to configure the device to change the costs of all its OSPF LSAs to be advertised to the maximum value so that the other devices on the network can be instructed not to use this device to forward data. In this way, service traffic can be switched to the other M-LAG member device in advance. To switch the service traffic back to the original M-LAG member device after maintenance is complete, run the undo ospf advertise max-cost command to restore the original costs of these OSPF LSAs. Using the ospf advertise max-cost command and its undo form in this scenario prevents traffic loss."
