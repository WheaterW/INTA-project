    "ExtraInfo": "This command applies to DHCP servers. To meet different client requirements, DHCP supports dynamic, automatic, and static address assignment.Different hosts require different IP address leases. For example, if some hosts such as a DNS server need to use certain IP addresses for a long time, run the lease command to set the IP address lease of the current global address pool to unlimited. If some hosts such as a portable computer just need to use temporary IP addresses, run the lease command to set the IP address lease of the current global address pool to the required time so that the expired IP addresses can be released and assigned to other clients.When a DHCP client starts and 50% or 87.5% of its IP address lease has passed, the DHCP client sends a DHCP Request message to the DHCP server to renew the lease.- If the IP address can be assigned to the client, the DHCP server informs the client that the IP address lease can be renewed.- If the IP address can no longer be assigned to the client, the DHCP server informs the client that the IP address lease cannot be renewed. The client needs to request for another IP address.You can run the display ip pool command to view information about the IP address lease. The values of the lease and left fields in the command output indicate the configured lease time and remaining lease time, respectively."
