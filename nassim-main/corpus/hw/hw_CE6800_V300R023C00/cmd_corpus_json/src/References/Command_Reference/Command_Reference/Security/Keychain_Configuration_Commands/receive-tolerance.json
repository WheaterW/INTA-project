    "ExtraInfo": "In keychain authentication mode, secure protocol packet transmission is provided by changing the authentication algorithm and key dynamically. Each key ID is configured with an authentication algorithm. When a key ID becomes valid, the corresponding authentication algorithm is used, ensuring the dynamic change of authentication algorithms.\nDue to the networking environment or clock asynchronization on the packet sender and receiver, packet transmission may be delayed. The receiver may receive a packet sent from the sender after its key ID for packet receiving becomes invalid. As a result, the receiver discards the packet and packet transmission is interrupted. To address such a problem, set a tolerance time to ensure that the validity period of the key ID for packet receiving on the receiver expires after all packets sent from the sender reach the receiver."
