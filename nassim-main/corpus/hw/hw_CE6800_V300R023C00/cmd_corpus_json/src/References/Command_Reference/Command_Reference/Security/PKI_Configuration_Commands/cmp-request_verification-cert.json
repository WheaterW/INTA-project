This command configures the CA certificate.\nIf this command is not executed and the CA response mode is signature, the device constructs a certificate chain based on the certificates in the response messages sent by the device itself and CA to verify the CA response signature. If the MAC mode is set, the device uses the MAC to verify the CA response signature. That is, this command does not take effect."
