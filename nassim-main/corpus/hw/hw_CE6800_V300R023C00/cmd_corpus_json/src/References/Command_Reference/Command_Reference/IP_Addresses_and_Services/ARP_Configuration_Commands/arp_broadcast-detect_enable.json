    "ExtraInfo": "If the VXLAN tunnel or Layer 2 sub-interface on the local device is down, the ARP entries learned from the VXLAN tunnel or Layer 2 sub-interface are deleted. As a result, traffic cannot be forwarded. By default, the device triggers ARP Miss messages through traffic forwarding to relearn ARP entries. To enable the device to quickly learn ARP entries, enable ARP broadcast probe on the VBDIF interface.\nFor example, in a distributed VXLAN gateway scenario, if a Layer 2 sub-interface on a device is down and ARP broadcast probe is enabled, the device broadcasts ARP request packets based on the ARP entries learned by the Layer 2 sub-interface to relearn ARP entries."
