The peer keychain command applies a keychain to a Multicast Source Discovery Protocol (MSDP) peer, so that the peer can use this keychain to authenticate TCP connection setup and MSDP message exchange requests. The undo peer keychain command cancels keychain authentication for an MSDP peer. By default, keychain authentication is not configured for an MSDP peer.
