The tc-protection threshold command sets the maximum number of topology change notification messages that can be processed during the topology change protection interval. The undo tc-protection threshold command restores the default maximum number of topology change notification messages that can be processed during the topology change protection interval. By default, an ERPS ring processes three topology change notification messages during the topology change protection interval.
