    "ExtraInfo": "When a device running RIP is connected to a network running other routing protocols, you can run the silent-interface command on the interface that connects the device to the network. This disables the interface from sending packets to the network and also prevents routing loops.\nThis command can be used together with the peer (RIP) command to advertise routes to a specified device."
