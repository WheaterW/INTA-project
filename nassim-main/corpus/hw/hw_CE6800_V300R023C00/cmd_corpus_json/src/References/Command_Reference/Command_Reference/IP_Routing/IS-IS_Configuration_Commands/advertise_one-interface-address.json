To implement interworking between Huawei devices and these non-Huawei devices, run the advertise one-interface-address command on the Huawei devices to enable the type-132 TLV in LSPs to carry the IP address of only one IS-IS interface.\nAfter the command is run, the interface IP address carried in the type-132 TLV in LSPs is selected as follows:"
