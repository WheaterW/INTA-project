    "ExtraInfo": "In a scenario in which the routes of a VPN instance IPv6 address family need to be imported into a public network VPNv6 routing table, if the routing information to be imported into the VPNv6 routing table needs to be specified or attributes need to be set for the routes imported into the VPNv6 routing table, an export route-policy must be applied to the VPNv6 instance IPv6 address family.\nCompared with the export route-policy command, the peer route-policy export or peer filter-policy export command configured in the BGP-VPN instance IPv6 address family view is used to filter the routes advertised by the VPN instance IPv6 address family to the CE (a BGP peer).\nBy default, ERTs are added to VPN routes before these routes are matched against an export routing policy. If the export routing policy contains RT-related filtering rules, these rules cannot apply to these routes. If you want to apply the RT-related filtering rules defined in an export routing policy to VPN routes, run the add-ert-first command to configure the system to add ERTs to VPN routes before matching these routes against the export routing policy.\nIn local route leaking scenarios, you can run the export route-policy command to filter out locally leaked routes and set the attributes of these routes. Locally leaked routes include both locally imported routes and routes learned from VPN peers."
