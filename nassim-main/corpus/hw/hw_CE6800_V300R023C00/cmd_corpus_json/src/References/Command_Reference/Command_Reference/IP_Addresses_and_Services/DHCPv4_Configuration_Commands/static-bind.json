    "ExtraInfo": "The static-bind command applies to DHCP servers. When planning a network, you need to allocate fixed IP addresses to some important hosts to ensure reliability. In this case, you can bind IP addresses in the address pool to the MAC addresses of these hosts. After the preceding configuration is complete, if the host of the MAC address to which the IP address is bound request an IP address from the DHCP server, the DHCP server finds the bound IP address based on the host's MAC address and allocates this IP address to the host, ensuring that the IP address obtained by the host is fixed."
