    "ExtraInfo": "When there are public network routes generated by multiple types of routing protocols on a device, you can run the ip frr command to enable IP FRR among public network routes so that traffic can be immediately switched if certain routes fail. This ensures uninterrupted traffic forwarding. The following example shows how IP FRR works:\nThere are two routes to 1.1.1.1 on a device. One is an OSPF route with priority 15, and the other one is a static route with priority 60. When IP FRR is not enabled, the OSPF route is preferred. After IP FRR is enabled, the OSPF route functions as the primary route, and the static route functions as the backup route. If the OSPF route fails, the system immediately switches traffic to the static route to ensure uninterrupted traffic forwarding."
