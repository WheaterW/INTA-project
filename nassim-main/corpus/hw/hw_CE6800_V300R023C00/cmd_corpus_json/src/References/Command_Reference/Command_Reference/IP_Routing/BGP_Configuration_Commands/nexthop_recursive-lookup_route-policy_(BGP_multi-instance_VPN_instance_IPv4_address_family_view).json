    "ExtraInfo": "BGP needs route recursion in case of next hops. If route recursion is not limited, BGP routes may be incorrectly iterated, causing traffic loss. Therefore, next hops should perform recursion according to certain conditions.\nTo control route recursion based on a route-policy, run the nexthop recursive-lookup route-policy command. If a target recursive route is filtered out by the route-policy, the route is considered unreachable. In this manner, BGP route recursion will fail."
