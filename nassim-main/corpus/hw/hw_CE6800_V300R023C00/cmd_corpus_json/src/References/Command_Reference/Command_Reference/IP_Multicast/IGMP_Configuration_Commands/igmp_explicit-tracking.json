    "ExtraInfo": "In Layer 3 multicast scenarios, after a multicast device receives a host's Leave message for a group, the device sends a group-specific Query message and considers that the host has left the group only if the device does not receive a response from the host within a specified wait period.\nTo speed up the device's response to host leave requests, run the igmp explicit-tracking command to enable host tracking. After this function takes effect, the device records group join status of each multicast host and does not send a group-specific Query message any more after receiving a Leave message. The device considers that a host has left a group immediately after receiving a Leave message from the host. This function shortens the leave process and reduces network bandwidth consumption."
