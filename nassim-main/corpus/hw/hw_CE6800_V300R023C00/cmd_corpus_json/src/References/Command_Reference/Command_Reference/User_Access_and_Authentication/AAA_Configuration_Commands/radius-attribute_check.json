The undo radius-attribute check command disables the device from checking the specified attributes in the received RADIUS Access-Accept packets. By default, the device does not check whether a RADIUS Access-Accept packet contains the specified attributes.",

            "Info": "Specifies the name of the RADIUS attribute.

    "ExtraInfo": "After the radius-attribute check command is executed, the device checks whether the received RADIUS Access-Accept packets contain the specified attributes. If yes, the device considers that authentication was successful; if not, the device considers that authentication failed and discards the packet. For example, after the radius-attribute check filter-id command is executed, the device checks the filter-id attribute in the received RADIUS Access-Accept packets. If a RADIUS packet does not contain this attribute, authentication fails."
