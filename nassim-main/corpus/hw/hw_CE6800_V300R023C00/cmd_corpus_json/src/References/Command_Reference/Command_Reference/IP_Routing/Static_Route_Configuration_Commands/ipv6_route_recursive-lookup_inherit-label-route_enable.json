    "ExtraInfo": "The next hop of a route may not be directly reachable. Such a route cannot guide packet forwarding and needs to be recursed. During route recursion, you can run the ipv6 route recursive-lookup inherit-label-route enable command to enable route recursion to remotely leaked VPN routes. If a route can be recursed to a remotely leaked VPN route, the route correctly inherits the label and tunnel ID of the remotely leaked VPN route to guide traffic forwarding."
