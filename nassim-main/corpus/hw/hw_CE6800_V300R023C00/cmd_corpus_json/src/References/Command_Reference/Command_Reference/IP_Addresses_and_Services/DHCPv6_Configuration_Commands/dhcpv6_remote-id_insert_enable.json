    "ExtraInfo": "The remote ID carries information about a client and identifies a client. The DHCPv6 server can make decisions about address allocation, parameter setting, and prefix agent according to the remote ID. The remote ID is defined by the vendor. Usually, the remote ID carries the phone number of the caller in dialing, user name, IP address of the peer in a point-to-point connection, and access interface."
