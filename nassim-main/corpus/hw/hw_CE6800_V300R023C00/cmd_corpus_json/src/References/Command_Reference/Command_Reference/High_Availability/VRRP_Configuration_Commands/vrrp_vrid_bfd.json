    "ExtraInfo": "If the link between devices in a VRRP backup group fails, the VRRP backup group performs a master/backup VRRP switchover only after a period of three times the interval at which VRRP Advertisement packets are sent. During this period, service data may be lost. To prevent this issue, run the vrrp vrid bfd command to create a VRID-based dynamic BFD session for the VRRP backup group. After the creation is complete, the BFD session monitors the link status in real time. When the BFD session detects a link fault and goes Down, the BFD module immediately instructs the VRRP module to perform a rapid master/backup VRRP switchover."
