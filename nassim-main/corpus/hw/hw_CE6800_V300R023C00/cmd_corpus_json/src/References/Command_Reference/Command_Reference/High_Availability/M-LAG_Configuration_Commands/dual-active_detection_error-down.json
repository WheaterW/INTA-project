    "ExtraInfo": "When an access device is single-homed to M-LAG master and backup devices at Layer 3, traffic forwarding on the device is not affected in a dual-active scenario where the peer-link fails but the DAD heartbeat status is normal. To prevent packet loss, you can run the dual-active detection error-down command to disable or delay the action of setting interfaces except the management interface and peer-link interface on one M-LAG device to error-down state when the peer-link fails but the DAD heartbeat status is normal.\nIf delay-time is set to 0, the system does not delay the action of setting interfaces except the management interface and peer-link interface on one M-LAG device to error-down state when the peer-link fails but the DAD heartbeat status is normal."
