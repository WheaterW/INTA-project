The snmp-agent local-engineid command sets an engine ID for a local SNMP agent. The undo snmp-agent local-engineid command restores the engine ID of a local SNMP agent to the default value.

    "ExtraInfo": "Each device managed by the NMS needs only one engine ID to identify an SNMP agent. By default, each device has one engine ID. The network administrator needs to ensure that every engine ID in a domain is unique. Communication between the NMS and SNMP agent can be authenticated and encrypted using this engine ID.\nThe snmp-agent local-engineid command configures the engine ID of a local SNMP entity. The algorithm for generating the engine ID follows the following rules:"
