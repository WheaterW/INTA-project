    "ExtraInfo": "A large number of VRRP packets are sent by multiple master devices when multiple common VRRP groups are configured. The VRRP packets consume network bandwidth resources and burden the system. The vrrp vrid admin command can be run to configure an mVRRP group. The mVRRP group sends VRRP packets and determines the status of services VRRP groups that are bound to the mVRRP group. Using mVRRP reduces resource consumption."
