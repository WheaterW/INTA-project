    "ExtraInfo": "After the peer check-first-as enable command is run, BGP checks whether the first AS number in the AS_Path list carried in the Update message sent by a specified EBGP peer is the AS where the EBGP peer resides. If the two AS numbers are different, the Update message is denied. If the peer check-first-as disable command is run, BGP does not check the first AS number in the AS_Path list carried in the Update message sent by a specified EBGP peer. That is, BGP accepts the Update message even if the first AS number is not the AS number of the EBGP peer. This undo command deletes the configuration of the specified EBGP peer and restores the default configuration.\nThe check on the first AS number in the AS_Path attribute of each received Update message can be configured for a specified EBGP peer, the peer group that the EBGP peer belongs to, or the entire BGP process. The configuration takes effect in descending order of priority as follows: EBGP peer > peer group > entire BGP process."
