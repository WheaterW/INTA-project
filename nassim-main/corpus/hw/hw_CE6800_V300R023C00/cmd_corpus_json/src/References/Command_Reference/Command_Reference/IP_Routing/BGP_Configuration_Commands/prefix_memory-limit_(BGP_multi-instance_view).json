    "ExtraInfo": "If BGP keeps receiving BGP routes from peers after the memory usage reaches the upper limit, the local device will restart and a master/slave main control board switchover will be performed, which affects system stability. To address this problem, run the prefix memory-limit command to enable BGP memory protection. With BGP memory protection, BGP will no longer receive BGP routes from peers and a log will be generated if the memory usage reaches the upper limit."
