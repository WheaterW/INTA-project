    "ExtraInfo": "The earlier version-compatible function of an SSH server is applicable to the protocol version negotiation between the client and server. The client negotiates the protocol version, by comparing its own protocol version with the received packet. When the client version is earlier than the server version, the client uses its own version; otherwise, the client uses the higher version. After a TCP connection is set up between the client and server, the SSH client starts to negotiate with the server on the protocol version by running which they can work normally.\nBy comparing the protocol versions, the server determines whether to work with the client."
