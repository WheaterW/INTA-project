    "ExtraInfo": "When a switch that participates in traffic load balancing becomes faulty, the number of equal-cost routes reduces, and so all traffic needs to be load balanced again using the hash algorithm. As a result, traffic forwarding paths may change. Requests of the same user may be sent to different servers, greatly affecting the services in which sessions need to be maintained. To prevent this problem, run the load-balance ecmp stateful enable command. This command enables the ECMP load balancing consistency function so that hash calculation is performed only for traffic on the faulty link, without affecting traffic on other normal links."
