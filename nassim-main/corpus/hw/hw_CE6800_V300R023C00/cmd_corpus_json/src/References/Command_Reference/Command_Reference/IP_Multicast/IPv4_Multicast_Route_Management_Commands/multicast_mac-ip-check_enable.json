    "ExtraInfo": "For multicast packets, there is a mapping between MAC addresses and IP addresses. The last 23 bits of the MAC address of an IPv4 multicast packet must be the same as those of the IP address.\nYou can run this command to check the consistency between multicast MAC addresses and IP addresses and discard packets with inconsistent multicast MAC addresses and IP addresses."
