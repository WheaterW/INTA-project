    "ExtraInfo": "A BSR is responsible for collecting rendezvous point (RP)-set information on a PIM-SM network, encapsulating the RP-set information in a bootstrap message, and advertising the message to every PIM neighbor.\nBefore configuring PIM-SM inter-domain multicast, run the pim bsr-boundary command to configure BSR boundaries on interfaces of edge routers to divide PIM-SM domains.Configuring BSR boundaries for a PIM-SM network and the Internet also helps isolate the PIM-SM network from the Internet."
