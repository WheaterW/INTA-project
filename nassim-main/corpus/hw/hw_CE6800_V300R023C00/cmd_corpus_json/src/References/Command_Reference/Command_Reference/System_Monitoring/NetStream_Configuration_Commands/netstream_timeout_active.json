    "ExtraInfo": "Network traffic may burst intermittently, while the memory capacity of the NDE is limited. Earlier flows in the memory need to be exported to release space for the new flows. The process of exporting old flows is called aging. All flows in the NDE memory will be exported to the NSC for analysis.\nWhen the active time (from flow creation time to the current time) of an original or flexible flow exceeds the specified active aging time, the flow is exported to the destination.\nTo quickly detect the status of an active flow, set the active time to a small value; however, this setting increases the frequency at which NetStream packets are sent. To reduce the frequency at which NetStream packets are exported and improve statistics collecting efficiency, set the active time to a large value."
