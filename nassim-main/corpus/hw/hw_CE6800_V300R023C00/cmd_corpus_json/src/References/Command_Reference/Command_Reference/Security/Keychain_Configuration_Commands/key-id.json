    "ExtraInfo": "To improve transmission security of protocol packets, you need to periodically change the authentication and encryption algorithms of protocol packets to prevent unauthorized users from obtaining the authentication and encryption algorithms and keys. The keychain protocol can be used to periodically and dynamically change the authentication algorithm and key to ensure the security of protocol packet transmission without the need to manually change the algorithm and key.\nKeychain-based dynamic switching of the authentication algorithm is implemented through key IDs. Each keychain consists of multiple key IDs and each key ID is configured with an authentication algorithm. Different key IDs are valid in different time periods."
