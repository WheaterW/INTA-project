    "ExtraInfo": "Using the ingress replication mode to forward a large number of Broadcast&Unknown-unicast&Multicast (BUM) packets on a VXLAN network increases the network load and consumes lots of network bandwidth resources. To resolve the issue, run the vni mcast-group command on each VTEP to configure the multicast replication mode. In multicast replication mode, all VTEPs with the same VNI join the same multicast group. A multicast routing protocol, such as PIM, is used to create a multicast forwarding entry for the multicast group. When a VTEP receives a BUM packet from a local VM, it adds a multicast destination IP address to the BUM packet before sends the packet to the remote VTEPs based on the created multicast forwarding entry.\nAfter you run the vni mcast-group command, mappings between VNIs and multicast groups are established. After receiving a VXLAN multicast packet, the VTEP checks the UNI in the packet. If no matching mapping between the VNI and multicast group is found, the VTEP will discard the packet."
