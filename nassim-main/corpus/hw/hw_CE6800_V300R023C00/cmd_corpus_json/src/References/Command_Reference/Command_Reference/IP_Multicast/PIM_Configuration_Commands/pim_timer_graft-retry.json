The pim timer graft-retry command configures the interval at which Graft messages are retransmitted by an interface. The undo pim timer graft-retry command restores the default interval.

    "ExtraInfo": "On a PIM-DM network, if State-Refresh is enabled on pruned interfaces, it is possible that the forwarding function will never be restored. When a new multicast member is added to a pruned interface, PIM-DM uses the graft mechanism to restore the forwarding function on the interface to save time. In other words, a Router sends a Graft message to require an upstream Router to forward multicast data to this network segment. Upon receipt of the Graft message, the upstream Router returns a Graft-Ack message and re-enables the forwarding function on the interface that received the Graft message. If no Graft-Ack message is received after the pim timer graft-retry is run, the Router will keep sending the same Graft message before it receives a Graft-Ack message from the upstream device."
