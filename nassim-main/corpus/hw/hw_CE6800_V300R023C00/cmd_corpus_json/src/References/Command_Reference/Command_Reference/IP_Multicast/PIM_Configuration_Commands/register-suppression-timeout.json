    "ExtraInfo": "After receiving a Register-Stop message from the rendezvous point (RP), a device immediately stops sending Register messages and enters the register suppression state. To set a timeout period during which the device remains in the register suppression state, run the register-suppression-timeout command.\nIf the configured timeout period is too short, the RP frequently receives burst multicast data. If the configured timeout period is too long, the delay for a new receiver to join a multicast group is long when an (S, G) entry times out on the RP."
