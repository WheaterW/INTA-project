    "ExtraInfo": "If a gateway receives a large number of ARP requests within a short period and broadcasts the ARP requests in a BD, excessive ARP requests are forwarded. As a result, excessive network resources are used, and traffic congestion may occur. ARP broadcast suppression can effectively ease the pressure on gateways in handling ARP packets.\nARP broadcast suppression can effectively ease the pressure on gateways in handling ARP packets. After receiving an ARP request, a gateway searches the broadcast suppression table that contains the mapping between the IP and MAC addresses of each destination device."
