The stp transmit-limit command sets the maximum number of Bridge Protocol Data Units (BPDUs) that an interface sends every second. The undo stp transmit-limit command restores the default value. By default, the maximum number of BPDUs that interfaces send every second is the value configured using the stp transmit-limit (system view) command. If the stp transmit-limit (system view) command is not configured, an interface sends a maximum of six BPDUs every second.",

    "ExtraInfo": "On a network running STP, a device sends BPDUs to other devices on the same spanning tree at an interval of the Hello time. BPDUs are transmitted to help maintain network stability. If the device sends too many BPDUs within the Hello time, the transmission occupies excessive system and bandwidth resources.\nTo avoid this problem, run the stp transmit-limit command in the interface view to configure the maximum number of BPDUs that an interface sends every second. This configuration limits the rate at which an interface sends BPDUs and prevents the spanning tree protocol from occupying excessive system and bandwidth resources.\nThe Hello time is the value of the Hello timer and specifies the interval at which the device sends BPDUs. You can configure the Hello time using the stp timer hello command."
