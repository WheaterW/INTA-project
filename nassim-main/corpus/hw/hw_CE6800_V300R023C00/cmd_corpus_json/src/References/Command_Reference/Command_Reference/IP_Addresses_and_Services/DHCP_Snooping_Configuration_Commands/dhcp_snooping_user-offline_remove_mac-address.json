    "ExtraInfo": "If a user goes offline but its MAC address entry is not aged, the device forwards the DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 packets whose destination address is the IP address of the user based on the dynamic MAC address entry. After the dhcp snooping user-offline remove mac-address command is run, the user MAC address entry is deleted when the DHCP snooping binding entry is deleted. In addition, the device discards packets destined for offline users when the network-side interface is configured to discard unknown unicast packets."
