    "ExtraInfo": "IP subnet-based VLAN division is also called network layer-based VLAN division.\nNetwork layer-based VLAN division greatly reduces the workload of manual configurations and allows users to easily join a VLAN, move from one VLAN to another VLAN, or leave a VLAN.\nIP subnet-based VLAN division is applicable to networks that have traveling users and require simple management."
