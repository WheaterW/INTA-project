    "ExtraInfo": "If the primary server is unavailable, the device automatically switches services to the standby server and sends packets to the standby server. After the quiet interval before the primary server reverts to the active state expires, the device attempts to establish a connection with the primary server.- If the primary server is still unavailable, the device continues to send packets to the standby server until the next interval expires. Such a process repeats.- If the primary server is available, the device switches services to the primary server and sends packets to the primary server.The quiet interval before the primary server reverts to the active state ensures that the primary server can be restored immediately and reduces the number of detection times during the switchover.The default value is recommended."
