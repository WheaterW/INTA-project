    "ExtraInfo": "After BGP Add-Path is configured on an RR, the RR needs to send routes to a specified BGP peer. To configure the maximum number of routes that the RR can send to the peer, run the peer advertise add-path command. The actual number of routes that the RR can send to the peer is the smaller one of the value configured using the peer advertise add-path command and the actual number of routes selected by the RR. If the maximum number of routes that the RR can send to the peer is less than the actual number of routes selected by the RR, the RR selects the optimal and Add-Path routes based on the BGP route selection rules."
