    "ExtraInfo": "BGP uses AS numbers to detect routing loops. The AS numbers in the AS_Path of each received route are matched against the local AS number configured using the bgp command and the fake AS number configured using the peer local-as command.\nAfter the peer allow-as-loop command is executed to configure the number of local AS number repetitions, the BGP speaker can allow routes with repeated AS numbers in AS_Path to pass to meet the requirements of special scenarios."
