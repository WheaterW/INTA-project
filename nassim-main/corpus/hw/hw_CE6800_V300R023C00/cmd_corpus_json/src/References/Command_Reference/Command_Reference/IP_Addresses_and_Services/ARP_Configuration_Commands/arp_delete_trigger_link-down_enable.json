    "ExtraInfo": "By default, when a member interface of a VLAN goes Down, the device deletes the ARP entries learned by the member interface only after detecting that they are aged in an ARP probe. The device then updates routing entries. This processing mechanism may delay link switchover in an ECMP scenario.Run the arp delete trigger link-down enable command to enable the device to delete ARP entries learned by a member interface of a VLAN immediately after the interface link goes Down without waiting for the ARP aging probe result."
