    "ExtraInfo": "Router-Alert is a mechanism used to identify protocol packets. Packets carrying Router-Alert options are delivered to the routing protocol layer for processing.\nBy default, devices do not check whether packets carry Router-Alert options for the sake of compatibility, and send all IGMP messages to the upper layer for processing. To improve device performance, reduce costs, and ensure protocol security, the igmp-snooping require-router-alert command can be used to configure a device to discard IGMP messages that do not carry the Router-Alert option. After receiving IGMP messages, this device will check whether these messages carry the Router-Alert option. If the messages do not carry the Router-Alert option, this device will discard them."
