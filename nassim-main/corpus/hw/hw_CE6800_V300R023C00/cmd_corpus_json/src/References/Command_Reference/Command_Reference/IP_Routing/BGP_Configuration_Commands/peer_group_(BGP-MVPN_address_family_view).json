    "ExtraInfo": "On a large-scale BGP network, there are a large number of peers and many of them have the same routing policies. To configure these peers, you have to repeatedly use some commands. In such a case, configuring peer groups can simplify configurations. If you intend to perform the same configuration on several peers, create and configure a peer. Then, add the peers to the peer group. The peers will inherit the configurations of the peer group."
