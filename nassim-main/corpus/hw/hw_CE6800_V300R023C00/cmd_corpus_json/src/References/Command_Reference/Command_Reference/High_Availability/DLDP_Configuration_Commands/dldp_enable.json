    "ExtraInfo": "A unidirectional link may exist in an actual networking scenario. A unidirectional link problem occurs when a local device receives packets from a peer device, but the peer device cannot receive packets from the local device. A unidirectional link may result in problems such as loops in an STP-enabled network.\nDLDP monitors the link status of devices connected by optical fibers. If DLDP detects a unidirectional link, it automatically closes the port on the unidirectional link or instructs you to close the port. Closing the port prevents a traffic interruption.\nTo enable DLDP on the interface, run the dldp enable command to enable DLDP globally, and then run the dldp enable command on the interface to enable DLDP."
