    "ExtraInfo": "Network congestion may delay the transmission of a Query message from an IGMP Querier to a device. If a router port does not receive any IGMP Query message with source IP addresses other than 0.0.0.0 or PIM Hello packet within the aging time, it becomes a non-router port. If a dynamic router port ages before the Query message reaches a device, the device no longer sends Report or Leave messages upstream from this interface. This may lead to interruption of multicast data transmission. Therefore, if a network is instable, a larger aging time value is recommended for a dynamic router port. The device resets the aging time of a dynamic router port when the port receives an IGMP Query or PIM Hello message."
