    "ExtraInfo": "When a DHCP client goes online in two steps, the IP address requested by the DHCP client is in the IP address pool, but no lease record of the DHCP client is found in the address pool. For example, after obtaining an IP address from another DHCP server, a wireless user roams to the current DHCP server and the original IP address is in the address pool of the current DHCP server. Alternatively, the address pool is reset and the original user needs to go online again. In this case, when receiving a DHCP Request message from the DHCP client, the DHCP server keeps silent and does not reply the DHCP client with a DHCP NAK message. The DHCP client can apply for an IP address to go online again in four steps only after the two steps for the client to go online time out. As a result, the DHCP client is slow in obtaining an IP address. To force the DHCP server to reply with a DHCP NAK message, you can run the dhcp server force response command, so that the DHCP client can quickly enter the four-step process for going online and apply for an IP address again."
