    "ExtraInfo": "If a source VTEP on a VXLAN connects to multiple remote VTEPs on the same VXLAN segment, run the vni flood-vtep command to configure a centralized replication list that contains the IP addresses of those remote VTEPs. Among the remote VTEP IP addresses, only one is in the working state, and others are in the backup state. After the source NVE receives broadcast, unknown unicast, and multicast (BUM) packets, the local VTEP sends a copy of the BUM packets to a replicator. The replicator then sends the BUM packets to other VTEPs with the same VNI except for the source VTEP.\nIf BFD detects that the master VTEP is unavailable, it re-selects an available backup VTEP to function as the centralized replicator."
