    "ExtraInfo": "Generally, AS numbers range from 1 to 4294967295, including the public, private, and reserved AS numbers. If the private-4-byte-as enable command is not run, private AS numbers range from 64512 to 65534. AS number 65535 is reserved for special use. After the private-4-byte-as enable command is run, the private AS numbers range from 64512 to 65534 and from 4200000000-4294967294 to 65535 or 4294967295, which are reserved for special use.\nPublic AS numbers can be used over the Internet, whereas private AS numbers cannot be advertised to the Internet. If private AS numbers are advertised to the Internet, routing loops may occur. Therefore, private AS numbers are used only within a routing domain.\nThis command can be used to process the private and reserved AS numbers in the AS_Path attribute of BGP routes as required. The processing of the reserved AS numbers is the same as that of the private AS numbers.\nAfter this command is configured, if the AS path attribute contains only private AS numbers, BGP deletes the private AS numbers and then advertises these update routes."
