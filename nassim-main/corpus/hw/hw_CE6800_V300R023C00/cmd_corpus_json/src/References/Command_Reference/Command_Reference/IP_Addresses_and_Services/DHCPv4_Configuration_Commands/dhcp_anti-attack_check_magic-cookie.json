    "ExtraInfo": "The dhcp anti-attack check magic-cookie command applies to DHCP servers, DHCP relay agents, and DHCP clients. Devices from different vendors may use different DHCP implementation mechanisms. After checking the magic-cookie field in a received DHCP packet, a device may not allow the DHCP packet to pass through and discards the packet. As a result, DHCP becomes unavailable. To solve this problem, you can run the undo dhcp anti-attack check magic-cookie command to disable the function of checking the magic-cookie field in a DHCP packet, so that a DHCP packet with an incorrect value in the magic-cookie field can be properly forwarded."
