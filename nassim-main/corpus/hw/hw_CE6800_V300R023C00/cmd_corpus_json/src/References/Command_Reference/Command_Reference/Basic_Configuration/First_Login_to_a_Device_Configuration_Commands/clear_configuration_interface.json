    "ExtraInfo": "To configure an interface on a device for other use, original configurations on the interface need to be deleted one by one. If the interface has a large number of configurations, deleting these configurations one-by-one takes a long time and increases the maintenance workload. To reduce the maintenance workload and simplify the deletion operation, you can use this command to perform one-touch configuration clearance on an interface."
