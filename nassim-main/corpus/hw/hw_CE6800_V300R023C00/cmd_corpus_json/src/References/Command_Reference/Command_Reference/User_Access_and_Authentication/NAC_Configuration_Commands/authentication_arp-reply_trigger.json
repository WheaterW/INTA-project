    "ExtraInfo": "If a client in sleep mode receives an ARP request packet, it replies with an ARP response packet, which triggers authentication. However, the authentication fails because no user name or password is entered when the client is in sleep mode. If the client is awakened before the re-authentication interval (specified by the authentication timer re-authen authen-fail re-authen-time command) expires, the user has to wait for a period of time before triggering authentication again. In this case, you can disable the function of triggering authentication by ARP response packets so that authentication is not triggered by ARP response packets sent by clients in sleep mode."
