    "ExtraInfo": "A BSR message carries information about all candidate-rendezvous points (C-RPs) on the network. Therefore, if there are a large number of C-RPs, the length of a BSR message will exceed the maximum transmission unit (MTU) of an outbound interface. As a result, the BSR message cannot be processed and RP election fails. Consequently, multicast services cannot be transmitted normally. To resolve this problem, run the bsm semantic fragmentation command to enable BSR message fragmentation, so that the devices on the network can learn consistent RP information and MDTs can be successfully established.\nBSR message fragmentation is recommended because it can solve the problem faced by IP fragmentation that all fragments become unavailable due to loss of fragment information."
