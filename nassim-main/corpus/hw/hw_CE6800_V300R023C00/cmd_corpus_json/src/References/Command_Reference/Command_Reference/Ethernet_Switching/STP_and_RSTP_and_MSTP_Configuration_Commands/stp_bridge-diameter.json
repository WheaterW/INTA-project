    "ExtraInfo": "On a network running STP, the network diameter is the maximum number of devices between two devices. An improper network diameter may slow down network convergence and affect user communication.You can run the stp bridge-diameter command to set a proper network diameter based on the network scale. This helps accelerate network convergence.The following time parameters are related to the network scale:Hello TimeForward DelayMax Age"
