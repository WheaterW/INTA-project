    "ExtraInfo": "Port security is a security function that converts dynamic MAC addresses learned by an interface into secure MAC addresses.\nAfter port security is enabled on an interface, the switch converts dynamic MAC addresses learned by the interface into secure MAC addresses. In this case, the dynamic MAC address entries learned by the interface are deleted. When the number of MAC addresses learned by the interface reaches the upper limit, the interface no longer learns new MAC addresses. If the source MAC address of a packet received by an interface does not exist in the MAC address entries, the interface considers the packet as an attack packet and discards the packet, reports an alarm, or shuts down the interface."
