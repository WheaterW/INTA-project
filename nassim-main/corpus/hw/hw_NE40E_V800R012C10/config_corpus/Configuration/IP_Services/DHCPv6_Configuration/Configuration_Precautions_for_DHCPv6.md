Configuration Precautions for DHCPv6

#### Feature Requirements

**Table 1** Feature requirements
| Feature Requirements | Series | Models |
| --- | --- | --- |
| When the return packet path of the DHCPv6 relay agent is different from the request packet path, the relay service interface of the DHCPv6 relay agent does not support QinQ interfaces. Otherwise, DHCPv6 reply packets cannot be encapsulated with correct VLAN IDs. As a result, users fail to go online.  You are advised to configure different source IP addresses for two relay agents to ensure that the forward and return paths of packets are the same. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| In active/standby scenarios, if DHCPv6 relay return packets are transmitted along a different path, the DHCPv6 relay configurations on the relay interfaces must be the same. Different interfaces on the same DHCPv6 relay agent cannot be configured with the same link address (the corresponding command is dhcpv6 relay link-address). Double VLAN tags are not supported between the relay agent and client. Otherwise, DHCPv6 users cannot go online. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| The DHCPv6 PD prefix route advertised by the relay agent has a single next hop. If fast route update is configured, extra route forwarding resources are occupied. If there are a large number of DHCPv6 PD users, the users may be able to go online, but traffic forwarding may fail.  You are advised to run the undo single-nexthop bgp fast-refresh enable command to disable fast route update. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| If the path of DHCPv6 relay return packets is different from that of DHCPv6 relay request packets, DHCPv6 PD relay users cannot go online.  You are advised to configure different source IP addresses for two relay agents to ensure that the forward and return paths of packets are the same. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| A DHCPv6 relay agent cannot relay Relay-Forward request packets that are forwarded by other DHCPv6 relay agents and LDRAs. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| When the return packet path and request packet path of a DHCPv6 relay agent are different, different interfaces on the same DHCPv6 relay agent cannot use the same gateway address. Otherwise, DHCPv6 reply packets cannot be forwarded to the client side, and users fail to go online.  You are advised to configure different source IP addresses for two relay agents to ensure that the forward and return paths of packets are the same. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| Automatic recovery of DHCPv6 PD users after a restart. A maximum of 40K users' addresses can be recovered. If the number of users exceeds 40K, excess users' data cannot be written into files and cannot be restored after the restart.  Properly plan the number of PD users on the live network. If automatic recovery of DHCPv6 PD users upon restart is required, it is recommended that a maximum of 40K PD users be connected. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| When the return packet path and request packet path of the DHCPv6 relay agent are different, the server address and gateway address configured on the relay service interfaces of the two relay agents must be the same. Otherwise, DHCPv6 reply packets cannot be forwarded to the client side, and users fail to go online.  You are advised to configure different source IP addresses for two relay agents to ensure that the forward and return paths of packets are the same. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| When the DHCPv6 server and the DHCPv6 client are in the same link range, the DHCPv6 server must specify an address pool on the interface and cannot automatically search for an address pool. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| When the DHCPv6 server assigns PD prefixes, prefix routes cannot be advertised. Routes need to be generated using external methods, such as configuring static routes. Otherwise, traffic forwarding fails. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
