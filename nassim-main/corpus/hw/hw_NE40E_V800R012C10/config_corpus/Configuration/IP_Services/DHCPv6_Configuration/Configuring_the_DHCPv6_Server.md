Configuring the DHCPv6 Server
=============================

A DHCPv6 relay agent enables the DHCPv6 server and client on different links to exchange messages.

#### Pre-configuration Tasks

Before configuring the DHCPv6 server, complete the following tasks:

* Ensure that the DHCPv6 client and server can communicate with each other.
* If a DHCPv6 relay agent is deployed, configure routes between it and the DHCPv6 server.

[(Optional) Configuring the Function to Save or Restore DHCPv6 Data](../../../../software/nev8r10_vrpv8r16/user/vrp/dc_vrp_dhcpv6_server_cfg_0040.html)



[(Optional) Configuring IPsec Authentication for the DHCPv6 Server](../../../../software/nev8r10_vrpv8r16/user/vrp/dc_vrp_dhcpv6_server_cfg_0047.html)

To defend against certain network attacks, configure IPsec to authenticate messages between a DHCPv6 relay agent and server.
