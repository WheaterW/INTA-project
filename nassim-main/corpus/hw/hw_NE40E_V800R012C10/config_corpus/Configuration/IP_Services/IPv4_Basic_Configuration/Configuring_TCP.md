Configuring TCP
===============

You can improve the network performance by setting TCP parameters.

#### Usage Scenario

None


[Configuring TCP Timers](../../../../software/nev8r10_vrpv8r16/user/vrp/dc_vrp_ipv4_cfg_0031.html)

You can control the TCP connection time by setting the SYN-Wait timer and FIN-Wait timer.

[Specifying the Size of a TCP Sliding Window](../../../../software/nev8r10_vrpv8r16/user/vrp/dc_vrp_ipv4_cfg_0032.html)

By setting the sliding window size for TCP, you can set the sizes of the receiving buffer and transmitting buffer in the socket. This improves network performance.

[Setting the MSS Value for a TCP Connection](../../../../software/nev8r10_vrpv8r16/user/vrp/dc_vrp_ipv4_cfg_0043.html)

The minimum MSS value and maximum MSS value can be configured for TCP connections.

[Verifying the TCP Configuration](../../../../software/nev8r10_vrpv8r16/user/vrp/dc_vrp_ipv4_cfg_0033.html)

After configuring TCP, verify the configuration.
