Configuring a User ACL6
=======================

A User ACL6 defines rules to filter packets.

#### Usage Scenario

To process different types of traffic, users can configure a User ACL6 to perform traffic policing, traffic shaping, or traffic classification on traffic that matches the ACL6 rules.


[(Optional) Creating a Validity Period for an ACL6 Rule](../../../../software/nev8r10_vrpv8r16/user/vrp/dc_vrp_acl6_cfg_0064.html)

You can create a validity period for an ACL6 rule to control network traffic in a specified period.

User ACL6s match packets based on the source/destination IPv6 address, source/destination service group, source/destination user group, source/destination port number, and protocol type.
