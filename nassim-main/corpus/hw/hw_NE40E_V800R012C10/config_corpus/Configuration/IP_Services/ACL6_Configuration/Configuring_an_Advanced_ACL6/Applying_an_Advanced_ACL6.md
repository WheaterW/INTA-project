Applying an Advanced ACL6
=========================

Advanced ACL6s can be used in multicast packet filtering, QoS services, and routing policies.

#### Context

[Table 1](#EN-US_TASK_0172365074__tab_dc_vrp_acl6_cfg_005801) describes the typical applications of advanced ACL6s.

**Table 1** Typical applications of advanced ACL6s
| Typical Application | Usage Scenario | Operation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Multicast packet filtering | To filter multicast packets, configure an advanced ACL6 to receive or forward only the multicast packets that match the ACL6 rules. | For details on how to filter multicast packets, see   * [Setting a Multicast Source Address Range](dc_vrp_multicast_cfg_2011.html) * [Setting the Range of Valid C-RP Addresses](dc_vrp_multicast_cfg_2018.html) * [Setting a Valid BSR Address Range](dc_vrp_multicast_cfg_2020.html) * [Setting an SSM Group Address Range](dc_vrp_multicast_cfg_2024.html) |
| QoS services | To process different types of traffic, configure an advanced ACL6 to perform traffic policing, traffic shaping, or traffic classification on traffic that matches the ACL6 rules. | For details on how to process different types of traffic, see Configuring the Traffic Policing Policy, Configuring Traffic Shaping, and Configuring Traffic Behaviors. |
