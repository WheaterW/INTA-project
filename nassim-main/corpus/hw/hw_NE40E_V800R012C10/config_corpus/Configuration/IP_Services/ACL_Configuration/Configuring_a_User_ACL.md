Configuring a User ACL
======================

A User ACL defines rules to filter packets.

#### Usage Scenario

To process different types of traffic, users can configure a User ACL to perform traffic policing, traffic shaping, or traffic classification on traffic that matches the ACL rules.

Packets can be matched based on the source/destination IP address, source/destination service group, source/destination user group, source/destination port number, and protocol type.
