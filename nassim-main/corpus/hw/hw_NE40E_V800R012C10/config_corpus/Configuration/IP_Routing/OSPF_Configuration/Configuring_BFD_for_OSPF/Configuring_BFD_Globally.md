Configuring BFD Globally
========================

On two devices that need to establish a BFD session with each other, you can configure BFD for all the interfaces in a certain OSPF process.

#### Context

Perform the following steps on the Router that runs OSPF:


#### Procedure

1. Run [**system-view**](cmdqueryname=system-view)
   
   
   
   The system view is displayed.
2. Run [**bfd**](cmdqueryname=bfd)
   
   
   
   BFD is enabled globally.
3. Run [**commit**](cmdqueryname=commit)
   
   
   
   The configuration is committed.
