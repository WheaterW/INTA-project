Configuration Precautions for IPv4 static route

#### Feature Requirements

**Table 1** Feature requirements
| Feature Requirements | Series | Models |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Static routes cannot be recursed to SRv6 TE Policy Color-Only tunnels. If the route (such as a BGP route) on which the next hop of a static route is recursed uses a Color-Only tunnel, the static route inherits the Color-Only tunnel as the next hop. However, BFD for locator fast switching is not supported. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| The static routes to participate in FRR must have different priorities configured. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| When the number of configured static routes for load balancing exceeds the product specification limit, the preferred static route may change after the active preferred route is modified or the active/standby switchover is performed twice. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| Before you associate a static route with a BFD session, the session must have been created. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| If recursion depth-based static route selection is configured, the number of static routes for load balancing may decrease. As a result, static routes may fail to implement load balancing. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| When static routes are deployed, the following features are mutually exclusive:  1. BFD (Bidirectional Forwarding Detection) for static route  2. NQA (Network Quality Analysis) for static route  3. Association between static routes and EFM4  4. Permanent advertisement of static routes  Determine which feature to use based on the actual network conditions:  â BFD for static routes enables a static route to be bound to a BFD session. The BFD session detects the link status of the static route and determines whether to activate the static route.  â  Deploying NQA for static routes uses NQA test instances to detect the status of the link where the static route resides and determines whether to activate the static route based on the NQA test results. NQA for static routes can be deployed in special scenarios, for example, when BFD is not applicable to links between different ISPs or a link segment does not support BFD.  â  After EFM is associated with static routes, the system responds to the EFM Up/Down event of a specified interface and determines whether to activate static routes. This controls route advertisement and directs remote traffic.  â Permanent advertisement of static routes can be deployed if the customer wants to determine the forwarding path of service traffic so that traffic is not switched to another path even if a link fault occurs. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| The route recursive-lookup tunnel command can be used to recurse IPv4 VPN static routes whose next hops are on the public network to tunnels on the public network. After this command is run, the system preferentially recurses a static route to an IP route. If no matching IP route is available for recursion, the system does not recurse the static route to a tunnel. If a matching BGP route is available for recursion, the static route recurses to the BGP route. If a matching non-BGP route is available for recursion, the static route recurses to a tunnel based on the tunnel policy. If a matching network segment (non-host route) is available for recursion, the network segment address is used to recurse the static route to a tunnel. Therefore, the static route can recurse to a public network tunnel based on the next hop address only if a matching non-BGP route corresponding to the next hop is available. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
