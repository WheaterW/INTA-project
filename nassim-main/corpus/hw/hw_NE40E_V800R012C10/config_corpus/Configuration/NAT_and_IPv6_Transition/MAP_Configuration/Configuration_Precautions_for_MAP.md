Configuration Precautions for MAP

#### Feature Requirements

**Table 1** Feature requirements
| Feature Requirements | Series | Models |
| --- | --- | --- |
| In RUI scenarios, when a PPPoE user applies for Option 95, the user can obtain a MAP rule only when the user goes online from a local delegation address pool that can assign MAP prefixes and rules. When the user goes online from a remote address pool, the user cannot obtain a MAP rule. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| When a PPPoE user applies for Option 95 to go online from a remote address pool, the mapping rule delivered by the DHCPv6 server must be configured on the local device. Otherwise, the device does not forward the mapping rule delivered by the DHCPv6 server to the user. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| When a PPPoE user applies for Option 95 to go online from a remote address pool, the device cannot parse the MAP rule delivered by the DHCPv6 server in the relay header. Only the MAP rule in the innermost packet is forwarded to the user. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| In a distributed MAP-T scenario, a PPPoE user goes online from a remote address pool. When the DHCPv6 server replies with a packet carrying multiple Option 95 fields, the device forwards only the first valid Option 95 field to the user and discards the other Option 95 fields. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| The MAP-T/MAP-E feature does not support reassembly of IPv6 fragments received from the CPE. After receiving IPv6 fragments from the CPE, the device fails to forward the fragments in the MAP-E scenario. In the MAP-T scenario, the device does not reassemble the fragments but converts them into IPv4 fragments before forwarding them. Properly plan the network MTU to prevent IPv6 packet fragmentation. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| MAP-T/MAP-E does not support reassembly of IPv4 packets with more than two fragments received from the network side. If the network side receives an IPv4 packet with more than two fragments, the packet fails to be forwarded. Properly plan the network MTU to prevent IPv4 packet fragmentation. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| The MAP does not support the user-side VPN. The vpn configuration and the map-rule command are mutually exclusive in a prefix pool. If an AAA server authorizes a VPN instance, users access the VPN instance as common users, without the MAP function used.  If MAP needs to be deployed, do not deploy a user-side VPN. If the IPv4 stack of the terminal connected to the MAP user needs to access the IPv4 VPN network, specify the VPN when configuring the ipv4-prefix of the MAP rule. The IPv6 stack of the connected terminal cannot access the IPv6 VPN network. Therefore, such deployment must be avoided. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| When an EDSG is configured for traffic from the network side to the user side in a MAP-E or MAP-T scenario, the rate limit is performed on IPv6 packets after IPv4 translation is performed. Configure precision compensation. In MAP-T scenarios, the difference between the IPv6 header length and IPv4 header length is used for compensation. In MAP-E scenarios, the IPv6 header length is used for compensation. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
