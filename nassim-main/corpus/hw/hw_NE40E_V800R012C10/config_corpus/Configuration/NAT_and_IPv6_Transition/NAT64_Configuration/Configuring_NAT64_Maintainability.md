Configuring NAT64 Maintainability
=================================

This section describes how to configure the NAT64 maintainability function.

#### Usage Scenario

You can configure NAT64 maintainability to reinforce the device administrator's capability to monitor NAT64 services in real time.


#### Pre-configuration Tasks

Before you configure NAT64 maintainability, complete the following tasks:

* Configure basic NAT64 functions.
* Configure centralized NAT64 translation.


[Configuring the NAT64 Log Function](../../../../software/nev8r10_vrpv8r16/user/ne/dc_ne_nat64_cfg_0033.html)

You can configure the NAT64 log function to record NAT operation information in real time, which strengthens device maintainability.

[Configuring the NAT64 Alarm Function](../../../../software/nev8r10_vrpv8r16/user/ne/dc_ne_nat64_cfg_0034.html)

You can configure the NAT64 alarm function to strengthen the device administrator's capability to monitor NAT64 services in real time.

[Verifying the Configuration](../../../../software/nev8r10_vrpv8r16/user/ne/dc_ne_nat64_cfg_0035.html)

After configuring the Network Address Translation IPv6-to-IPv4 (NAT64) maintainability function, run the following **display** command to check NAT64 maintainability configurations.
