Verifying the Simplified NAT Configurations
===========================================

After configuring a simplified NAT instance, you can check the configuration of the address pool and internal servers in that instance.

#### Prerequisites

All the simplified NAT configurations are complete.


#### Procedure

* Run the [**display nat simple-configuration server**](cmdqueryname=display+nat+simple-configuration+server) command to check the configuration of the internal server function in a simplified NAT instance.
* Run the [**display nat simple-configuration address-group**](cmdqueryname=display+nat+simple-configuration+address-group) [ *address-group-name* ] command to check the configuration of a specific or all address pools in a simplified NAT instance.
* Run the [**display nat simple-configuration service-instance-group**](cmdqueryname=display+nat+simple-configuration+service-instance-group) command to check information about a service-instance-group and a service-location group that are generated by default in a simplified NAT instance.
