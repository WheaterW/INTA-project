Configuration Precautions for NAT

#### Feature Requirements

**Table 1** Feature requirements
| Feature Requirements | Series | Models |
| --- | --- | --- |
| The static source tracing algorithm cannot use a flexible log template to send flow and user logs. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| In centralized NAT444/DS-Lite dynamic load balancing scenarios, if boards are installed in the same chassis, pay attention to the following restrictions: 1. In inter-chassis backup scenarios, the two boards that back up each other must be of the same type and the same bandwidth license must be activated. Otherwise, the bandwidth may exceed the threshold, causing packet loss. 2. In inter-board backup scenarios, the two boards that back up each other must be of the same type and the same bandwidth license must be activated. Otherwise, the bandwidth may exceed the threshold, causing packet loss. 3. A CPU cannot be configured for two different service-location groups, and a service-location group cannot be configured for different NAT instances. Otherwise, the bandwidth exceeds the threshold during load balancing, causing packet loss. 4. If VSUI400 series and VSUI401 boards participate in load balancing, the bandwidth license must be activated. Otherwise, traffic cannot be forwarded after users go online. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| In a global address pool scenario, when the global address pool is exhausted, applying for a new address segment for an instance triggers the unused address reclamation. However, the initial segment allocated to a service-location group bound to the instance does not support the unused address reclamation, and only the extended segment supports this function. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| The nat server-mode enable command is run in the NAT instance view to configure an address-level NAT server and configure a local address pool to provide NAT services. If the public IP address of the NAT server overlaps with that of the local address pool, you are advised to use a fixed port range for the NAT server and run the exclude-port command to exclude the planned port range from the local address pool in the NAT instance. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| CGN service flows cannot be transmitted over distributed GRE tunnels. If both CGN services and distributed GRE tunnels are configured, traffic will be interrupted. If CGN service flows need to be transmitted over GRE tunnels, configure centralized GRE tunnels. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| After NAT is performed, traffic is redirected to an SRv6 tunnel. The restrictions are as follows:  Traffic redirection can be configured for policy-based routing (PBR) in a DS-Lite instance. Only user-to-network traffic can be redirected to SRv6 tunnels. Network-to-user traffic cannot be redirected to SRv6 tunnels. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| In centralized NAT scenarios:  1. After traffic leaves an SRv6 tunnel, it is diverted to NAT. A traffic policy can be configured only in an SRv6 VPN instance, but not on an interface.  2. After traffic leaves an SRv6 tunnel, it is diverted to NAT. NAT64, DS-Lite, and PCP services are not supported. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| When the static source tracing algorithm is used together with load balancing, the configuration parameters of the static source tracing algorithm must meet the following requirements:  1. The maximum number of private network users supported by a single public IP address must be a power of 2 (2^n is used as an example).  2. For each private network section, the number of IP addresses must be an integer multiple of 2^n, and the start IP address must be exactly divided by 2^n.  3. If an instance is bound to multiple static source tracing algorithms, the mappings must have the same power.  When the static source tracing algorithm is deployed together with load balancing, the preceding requirements must be met. Otherwise, the configuration fails. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| When the static source tracing algorithm is used together with load balancing, distributed CGN cannot be used together. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| The ALG cannot process TCP fragments. TCP fragments are transparently transmitted without being discarded.  Generally, the length of a TCP packet does not exceed the maximum segment size (MMS), and TCP fragmentation does not occur. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| ALG does not support packets longer than 2048 bytes. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| ALG sessions do not support hot backup. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| ALG supports TCP-based RTSP, not UDP-based RTSP. ALG also supports UDP-based SIP, not TCP-based SIP. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| The policy-based route configured in the CGN user domain or delivered by the RADIUS authentication server does not take effect. Configure policy-based route in the NAT instance. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| Parameters of the initial and extended address segments of a CGN global address pool must be planned based on the live network. If the parameters are not properly planned, the robustness of services on the live network will be affected. If the IP address needs to be replanned, the IP address can be changed only after all users go offline.  1. If the value of port-range configured in an instance is too large (for example, 64512) and the number of mask bits in the initial and extended segments is greater than 27 (for example, 30), users may fail to go online. In this case, users need to dial up for multiple times to go online.  2. If the range of a CGN global address pool is too small and address segments need to be replanned due to increasing service requirements, users must go offline and reconfigure address segments. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| If the CGN public address and network-side interface address are on the same network segment, run the nat gratuitous-arp send auto command on the network-side interface. Otherwise, traffic cannot be forwarded because the network-side device cannot learn the ARP entry of the interface network address. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| When the upper threshold for the number of address segments that a CGN device applies for from the RADIUS server for global dynamic address pools is set to 100%, the rate at which the CGN device applies for address segments from the RADIUS server decreases. Set a proper threshold. Otherwise, users may fail to apply for IP addresses and fail to go online. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| In an EasyIP scenario (the NAT address pool address/server public address can be reused as an interface address), it is not recommended to use the reused interface address as the interaction address of protocols such as BGP. Otherwise, when traffic congestion occurs on the NAT service board, non-NAT service packets whose source or destination address is the interface address and whose type is TCP/UDP/ICMP/GRE may be discarded, which may cause protocol interruptions. After BA or MF traffic classification is configured, modifying the internal priority of protocol packets can reduce the probability of discarding protocol packets (only applicable to the dedicated board scenario). | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| The CGN ALG can identify packets only through well-known ports. For example, the FTP ALG needs to identify TCP port 21. For the packets that need to be processed by the CGN ALG, well-known ports must be used. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| DNS mapping supports only address-level NAT server, not port-level NAT server. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| In an Easy IP scenario where a NAT address pool or NAT server public address is the same as an interface address, when a NAT traffic diversion policy or a global UCL-based traffic diversion policy is configured on a user-side interface, the user side fails to ping the reused interface address. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| FTP do not support two ALG scenarios. One is a private network client accesses a public network server in passive mode. The other is a public network client accesses a private network server in port mode.  In these cases, the control session is not associated with the data session. As a result, the control session ages when data is being downloaded. A file can be properly transferred, but the FTP interface displays a transfer failure. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| ICMP sessions do not support hot backup. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| NAT44 traffic diversion on an outbound interface can be used together with MPLS in the following scenarios:  1. MPLS IP. The outbound interface is a physical interface.  2. MPLS IP/L3VPN over TE, including TE, TE FRR, TE Detour FRR, TE load balancing, and TE protection group.  3. MPLS IP/L3VPN over LDP. The outbound interface is a physical interface, including LDP, LDP FRR, LDP load balancing, and LDP RLFA.  4. MPLS IP/L3VPN over LDP over TE, including TE, TE FRR, TE Detour FRR, TE load balancing, and TE protection group.  5. MPLS IP/L3VPN over BGP over TE, including TE, TE FRR, TE load balancing, and TE protection group.  6. MPLS IP/L3VPN over BGP over LDP. The outbound interface is a physical interface, including LDP, LDP FRR, LDP load balancing, and LDP RLFA.  7. MPLS IP/L3VPN over BGP over LDP over TE, including TE, TE FRR, TE load balancing, and TE protection group.  8. MPLS IP/L3VPN SR-MPLS TE, including node labels and link labels.  When other MPLS scenarios are used, traffic may fail to be forwarded or functions may fail (for example, load balancing or fast switching cannot be performed). | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| When both NAT444 and DAA are configured, the user group bound to the NAT444 instance must be configured in the DAA template.  If the user group for DAA switching is inconsistent with that bound to NAT, DAA does not take effect. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| In a NAT dynamic load balancing scenario, when a CPU fault in an instance is rectified or a load balancing member is added to the instance:  1. Distributed users on the original CPU are not affected, and new users can go online through the new CPU.  2. For centralized users on the original CPU, some users are switched to the new CPU, and traffic needs to be interrupted and re-established.  When address resources are sufficient, users that are not switched to the new CPU are not affected. When address resources are insufficient and address resources are reclaimed using the idle address reclamation, traffic of centralized users that are not switched to the new CPU may be interrupted and re-established.  Therefore, it is recommended that 30% of public IP addresses be reserved in dynamic load balancing scenarios to ensure fast switchover in fault recovery and capacity expansion scenarios. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| The following flow tables do not support HA backup: DNS, ALG, TCP three-way handshake failure, ICMP, fragment, and flow tables whose aging time is less than 10 seconds. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| In a distributed NAT dynamic load balancing scenario, after a dedicated board is expanded, users on the original CPU cannot be load balanced immediately. Users can go online from the new CPU only after they go offline. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| A NAT traffic distribution policy on an inbound interface and a NAT traffic distribution policy on an outbound interface cannot be applied to the same device. Only one traffic diversion mode can be used. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| Redirection to a directly connected network segment IPv6 address is not supported in a NAT instance. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| When the web function is used together with CGN, users who go online from the pre-authentication domain cannot directly access the portal server for authentication. They must visit another website and be forced to access the other portal servers before undergoing web authentication. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| When the web function is used together with CGN, the pre-authentication and authentication domains must be bound to the same NAT44 instance. Otherwise, the portal page cannot be pushed. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| In an Easy IP scenario where the NAT address pool/server public address and interface address are reused, when the source or destination address of a protocol packet is the Easy IP borrowed address, there is a possibility that the packet is discarded when the NAT board fails or becomes unavailable. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| When the web function is used together with CGN, the pre-authentication and authentication domains cannot be bound to NAT and DS-Lite instances, respectively. When the pre-authentication and authentication domains are bound to different instance types, users may be logged out during the switchover between the pre-authentication and authentication domains. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| In a distributed CGN scenario, when an ACL policy is used to select an address pool, the ACL policy can contain only user information. That is, the ACL policy contains only user addresses and VPN information. If the ACL policy contains other information, the ACL policy cannot be matched. As a result, public network resources fail to be obtained, and NAT processing fails. Plan services properly. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| After the TCP user log mode is configured and the NAT service engine is disabled, the user log transmission channel on the engine is deleted. As a result, user logout logs cannot be sent, and the server cannot collect or record these logs. To record user logout logs, manually log out users and then disable the NAT service engine. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| In BRAS+CGN scenarios, NAT is performed for user-to-network traffic, and users' private IP addresses are translated into public IP addresses. Therefore, the destination IP addresses of network-to-user traffic are public IP addresses, but BRAS users use private IP addresses. Therefore, user-based inbound traffic policy matching is not supported in the inbound direction on the network side. In the scenario where private network users communicate with each other (user-to-user direction), the traffic policy of the source user cannot be matched in the outbound direction. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| In a port-level NAT server scenario or an address-level NAT server scenario where the nat server-mode command is not run in an instance, an address pool must be configured (and an outbound policy must be bound in a dedicated board scenario). Otherwise, user traffic cannot be forwarded properly. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| A NAT policy is configured on an outbound interface. A device searches for the outbound interface based on routing information. Traffic cannot be returned through the inbound interface that receives the traffic. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| For the Easy IP function, do not use the reused interface address as the interactive address of the FTP (PASV mode), NQA, or RADIUS server. Otherwise, after the forward traffic is established, non-NAT service packets of TCP/UDP/ICMP/GRE may be incorrectly diverted, causing protocol interruptions.  If Easy IP and BFD services coexist, the NAT public port of Easy IP may be a well-known BFD port. As a result, returned NAT traffic cannot be forwarded.  For specific ports with a port number greater than 1024, run the exclude-port command in the instance view to filter the port numbers. For not specific ports with a port number greater than 1024, plan the port usage. For details about the well-known port numbers supported by the device, see the communication matrix in the product documentation. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| Configuring a simplified NAT instance and limiting the number of user-information-based sessions are mutually exclusive. Plan services properly. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| The static source tracing algorithm does not support VPNs. When a private network user belongs to a VPN, only the IP address of the private network user is used to match the static source tracing algorithm to create a flow. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| In a non-dedicated board service scenario, when a simplified NAT instance is configured, the configurations of a service-location group and a service-instance group are generated by default. The default configurations cannot be used by a non-simplified NAT/NAT64 instance. Plan services properly. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| When centralized NAT provides backup for distributed NAT, the distributed NAT device and centralized NAT device cannot use the same public NAT address. Therefore, the NAT server or port-forwarding function cannot be backed up. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| When distributed users are online:  1. The port-single function cannot be enabled or disabled.  2. The service-instance group cannot be deleted.  3. The service-location group bound to the service-instance group bound to an instance cannot be unbound.  4. The switchover between the non-port-range mode and the port-range mode cannot be performed.  5. The extended port range cannot be modified in the port-range module.  6. The number of extended allocations in port-range mode cannot be modified.  7. The switchover between 3-tuple and 5-tuple cannot be performed.  8. Outbound cannot be unbound.  9. The instance cannot be deleted.  10. The port-reuse function cannot be enabled or disabled.  Plan the configuration in advance to avoid configuration changes. The configuration can be changed only after the user goes offline.  For details, see the attachment. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| Before configuring the simplified NAT function, configure a simplified NAT instance before configuring the NAT address pool and NAT server. If no simplified NAT instance is configured, the NAT address pool and NAT server cannot be configured. Configure services correctly in sequence. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| When centralized NAT provides backup for distributed NAT, different private addresses or VPNs must be configured. Ensure that the private address routes of distributed NAT devices do not overlap after being advertised to the centralized NAT device. When VPN routes overlap, reverse traffic cannot be correctly forwarded. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| Layer 2 leased line users do not support distributed NAT. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| Simplified NAT supports only outbound-interface traffic diversion. A traffic diversion policy can be bound to an instance or an address pool. Only one traffic diversion policy can be bound to an interface. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| After a simplified NAT instance is configured, the configurations of a service-location group and a service-instance group are generated by default based on the default name. If the configurations of the service-location group and service-instance group already exist on the device, the simplified NAT instance fails to be created. Plan services properly. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| After the section <section-num> lock command is run in a NAT instance address pool, the public network resources that have been assigned to the address segment will not be reclaimed, and the public network resources that have not been assigned will not be assigned to new users. When calculating the address pool usage, the unallocated public network resources in the address segment are also counted as part of the total number of public network resources. However, the unallocated public network resources are not allocated to new online users. Therefore, the address pool usage formula is as follows: Number of allocated public network resources/Total number of public network resources (public network resources refer to public IP addresses or public network ports). The calculated address pool usage may not reflect the actual address allocation status, affecting the address pool usage query result and address pool usage threshold alarm. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| In the VPN scenario supported by the on-board NAT, VPN NAT users on the private network cannot access to the NAT device through Telnet or FTP.  You can configure VPN route leaking to import routes from the NAT device to the private VPN, or configure ACL rules on the traffic diversion board. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| In the address pool usage query and alarm functions of an instance, the ratio of the number of allocated ports to the total number of available ports is the address pool usage.  If the maximum number of access users using a single IP address, locking the address pool, adding an IP address to the blacklist is configured in an instance, or the number of configured port ranges cannot be exactly divided by the number of available ports (64512) using a single IP address, even if the address pool usage may not reach 100%, private network users cannot go online because they cannot apply for public network resources.  After an IP address segment in the address pool is locked, delete the IP address segment as soon as possible and configure a proper port range. Otherwise, the calculation of the address pool usage is affected, and the threshold alarm and exhaustion alarm are affected. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| On the same device, both NAT and IPsec can be performed for the same flow in the following scenarios:  1. Only the NAT inbound interface traffic diversion mode is supported. User-to-network traffic matches a traffic policy on the private network inbound interface and is sent to the NAT board for NAT. Then, the NAT board searches for a route and sends the traffic to the IPsec tunnel for encryption.  2. A dedicated NAT instance needs to be created and a dedicated address pool needs to be used. The Easy IP mode in which interface addresses are reused is not supported.  In other scenarios, NAT and IPsec cannot be performed for the same flow on the same device. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| A public network interface address is pinged using an IP address in an address pool as the source IP address. If the ping reply packet is fragmented into three or more fragments, the ping operation fails. Do not ping any address in a CGN public address pool, or ensure that the ping packet length does not exceed the interface MTU. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| The aging time of the NAT ALG flow table does not take effect based on the configured application-layer aging time. Instead, the aging time of the NAT ALG flow table takes effect based on the TCP and UDP aging time. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| If session-end-only is configured before a flow table is created and is changed to session-start-only before a flow table ages, a log server cannot store source tracing information about the session after the flow table ages. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| A NAT address pool or NAT server cannot be configured in a simplified NAT instance. Plan services properly. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| When multiple equal-cost outbound interfaces are used for route load balancing, the source IP address is used as the hash factor for upstream traffic to find the corresponding outbound interface. After an ACL rule is matched on the outbound interface and NAT is performed, the source IP address is replaced. In this case, the outbound interface may change when hash is performed based on the new source IP address. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| Currently, NAT ALG can process only RTSP control messages of SETUP, REPLAY, and TEARDOWN. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| In load balancing scenarios, a maximum of 16 service-location groups can be configured for a service-instance group. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| In a DS-Lite scenario, if an SRv6 tunnel is deployed on the user side, network-to-user packets cannot enter the SRv6 tunnel after DS-Lite is performed. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| In an outbound interface NAT scenario, traffic after NAT cannot enter an SRv6 tunnel. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| In an outbound interface NAT scenario, if a route redirection traffic diversion policy needs to be configured on the user-side inbound interface, configure a forward policy (with only the next-hop IP address specified but not the outbound interface) and configure redirection in the NAT instance.  A forward policy ensures that outbound interface NAT is performed before traffic is forwarded through the outbound interface. If a discard policy is configured on the inbound interface (with the next-hop IP address and outbound interface specified), traffic is directly forwarded through the outbound interface, and outbound interface NAT does not take effect.  In a forward policy scenario, after outbound interface NAT is performed, a device searches for a route based on the destination IP address of a packet and forwards the packet. To prevent the device from forwarding the packet through another outbound interface different from the original outbound interface, you need to configure redirection in the NAT instance. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| At a moment when the fast forwarding table is created, there is a possibility that packets are forwarded out of order. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| After redirection is configured for a specific user's traffic in a CGN instance, all traffic in the instance fails to be fast forwarded. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| Traffic destined for BRAS users enters only QoS BE queues after CGN services are complete. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| If a device has a CGN-enabled subcard, the undo frame padding fixed enable command cannot be run on the CXP/IPU. If the undo frame padding fixed enable command is configured, the padding cannot be removed for packets with padding. Plan services properly. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| Only non-fragmented TCP and UDP packets support fast forwarding. Other types of packets support only slow forwarding. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| If only the DS-Lite traffic diversion license and RTU bandwidth license are configured but the DS-Lite function license is not configured, the bandwidth of the bandwidth license is occupied, but packet loss occurs on the CGN subcard. Properly plan traffic diversion and function licenses. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| When NAT traffic distribution is configured on an outbound interface, an ACL rule takes effect on data flows based only on the protocol number, source/destination IP address, source/destination port number, VPN instance name, and fragment. NAT traffic distribution on an outbound interface does not support the following ACL rules: vpn-instance-any, TTL, and TCP-FLAG, destination-pool, packet-length, source-pool, destination-port-pool, source-port-pool, VXLAN, ICMP-type, time-range, ToS, DSCP, ip-precedence, and inconsecutive masks. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| Packets carrying the IP option do not support the NAT service. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
