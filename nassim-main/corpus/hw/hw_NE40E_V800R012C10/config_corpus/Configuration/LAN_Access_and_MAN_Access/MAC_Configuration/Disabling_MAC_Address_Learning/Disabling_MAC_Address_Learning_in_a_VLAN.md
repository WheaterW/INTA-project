Disabling MAC Address Learning in a VLAN
========================================

Disabling MAC address learning in a VLAN helps defend against MAC address attacks and improves security for users in this VLAN.

#### Context

If a device has only one inbound interface and one outbound interface or the network is stable and safe, MAC address learning can be disabled in the VLAN to save space of the MAC address table. For details, see [Disabling MAC Address Learning in a VLAN](dc_vrp_vlan_cfg_0025.html).
