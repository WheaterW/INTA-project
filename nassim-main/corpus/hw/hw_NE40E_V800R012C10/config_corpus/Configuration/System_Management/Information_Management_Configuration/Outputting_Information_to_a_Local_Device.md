Outputting Information to a Local Device
========================================

Information can be output to an information file or information buffer on a local device. You can also set certain properties of the information file or buffer.

#### Usage Scenario

The system logs information about device operation in real time. Information can be output to a local device for the query of login users, allowing users to know the operation of the device.


#### Pre-configuration Tasks

Before outputting information to a local device, ensure that the device is powered on correctly and the self-test is successful.

An information buffer can store multiple latest information records generated by the system. You can set the size of the information buffer or the channel through which information is output to the information buffer.

Information output to the information file can be saved on the device in the format of files. This allows users to quickly locate the fault occurring on the device based on the information.
