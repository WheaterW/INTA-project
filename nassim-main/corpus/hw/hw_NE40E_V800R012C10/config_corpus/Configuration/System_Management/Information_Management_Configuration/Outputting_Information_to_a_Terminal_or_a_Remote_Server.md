Outputting Information to a Terminal or a Remote Server
=======================================================

The specified information can be output to a console, remote terminal, syslog server, or SNMP agent through different channels.

#### Usage Scenario

The system logs information about device operation in real time. After configuring logs to be output to a terminal or a remote server, you can view logs saved on the log host to assist in understanding the device operation.


#### Pre-configuration Tasks

Before outputting information to a terminal or a remote server, ensure that the device is powered on correctly and the self-test is successful.


[Outputting Information to a Console](../../../../software/nev8r10_vrpv8r16/user/vrp/dc_vrp_logs_cfg_2032.html)

Information can be output to a console for the query of users logging in to the device through a serial interface. This allows users to learn the operating status of the device.

[Outputting Information to a Remote Terminal](../../../../software/nev8r10_vrpv8r16/user/vrp/dc_vrp_logs_cfg_2033.html)

Information can be output to a console for the query of users logging in to the device through the Virtual Type Terminal (VTY) or Telnet. This allows users to learn the operating status of the device.

[Sending Information to a Syslog Server](../../../../software/nev8r10_vrpv8r16/user/vrp/dc_vrp_logs_cfg_2034.html)

Information can be sent to a Syslog server for user query. This allows users to learn the device operation in real time.

[Outputting Information to an SNMP Agent](../../../../software/nev8r10_vrpv8r16/user/vrp/dc_vrp_logs_cfg_2035.html)

This section describes how to output information to an SNMP agent. Users can learn the device operation by using an NMS to view information.

[Outputting Information to a File Server](../../../../software/nev8r10_vrpv8r16/user/vrp/dc_vrp_logs_cfg_2065.html)

By outputting information to a file server, you can learn about the device operation.

[Verifying the Configuration of Outputting Information to a Terminal or a Remote Server](../../../../software/nev8r10_vrpv8r16/user/vrp/dc_vrp_logs_cfg_2036.html)

After configuring information management, verify the configuration.
