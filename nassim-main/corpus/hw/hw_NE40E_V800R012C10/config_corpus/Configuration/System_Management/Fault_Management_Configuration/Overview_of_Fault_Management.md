Overview of Fault Management
============================

FM enhances network reliability.

#### Definition

The fault management function is one of five functions (performance
management, configuration management, security management, fault management,
and charging management) that make up a telecommunications management
network. The primary purposes of this function are to monitor the
operating anomalies and problems of devices and networks in real time
and to monitor, report, and store data on faults and device running
conditions. Fault management also provides alarms, helping users isolate
or rectify faults so that affected services can be restored.


#### Purpose

With the popularity of networks, complexity of application environments,
and expansion of network scales, our goal must be to make network
management more intelligent and effective. Improving and optimizing
fault management will help us meet this goal. Improved fault management
can achieve the following:

* Reduction in the volume of alarms generated
  
  Alarm masking,
  alarm correlation analysis and suppression, and alarm continuity analysis
  functions are supported to provide users with the most direct and
  valid fault alarm information and to lighten the load on the fault
  management system. Such support for efficient fault location and diagnosis
  enhances the ability of the network element (NE) management system
  to manage same-network NEs and cross-network NEs.
* Guaranteed alarm reporting
  
  Use of the active alarm table
  and internal reliability guarantee mechanism allows alarms to be displayed
  immediately so that faults can be rapidly and correctly located and
  analyzed.
