#### Feature Requirements

**Table 1** Feature requirements
| Feature Requirements | Series | Models |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 10GE WAN interfaces do not support 1588. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| In the lightweight clock mode, a maximum of 20 hops are supported (the synchronization of the slave chassis to the master chassis is considered as one hop). The end-to-end time synchronization performance can only meet the requirement of +/-500 us. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| When the lightweight clock mode is enabled on the cluster device, the cluster device also uses lightweight clock synchronization between chassis. The slave chassis only synchronizes time with the master chassis, but does not synchronize the frequency. Therefore, if the cluster device is used to export the frequency to the downstream application, note that only the master chassis can export the frequency synchronization source to the downstream device. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| With the Layer 3 unicast negotiation function, the server can provide the delay\_resp packet sending rate ranging from 128 Hz to 1/32 Hz for the client, but cannot provide the delay\_resp packet sending rate ranging from 1/64 Hz for the client. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| PTP packets support only one-layer VLAN encapsulation. PTP packets do not support more than one-layer VLAN encapsulation or MPLS encapsulation. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| The same protocol type must be configured at both transmit and receive ends of signals on 1PPS+TOD external time interfaces.  If the ubx or nmea parameter is configured, the device cannot obtain the clock class from an external time source. It cannot detect any clock class degrade on the upstream device or perform source switching when such degrade occurs.  After the clock tod protocol ccsa command is executed, the PPS status of TOD input and output external time signals is converted into the clock class based on the CCSA standard. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| 10GE interfaces in WAN mode do not support 1588v2.  It is recommended that the LAN mode be used or another interface that supports 1588v2 be used. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| Acacia CFP2-DCO colored optical modules (OSN B00C02) do not support PTP time synchronization. After an Acacia CFP2-DCO colored optical module is installed and PTP time synchronization is configured, an hwPtpPortNonSupport alarm is reported, affecting time synchronization deployment.  When planning the time topology, do not deploy the time source on the Acacia CFP2-DCO colored optical module interface. Instead, use the ETH mode. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| Due to hardware limitations, the following performance counters required by G.8273.2 cannot be supported by the X3A router:  1. Incompliance with ITU-T G.8273.2 section 7.3.1: low-pass feature. The bandwidth ranges from 0.5 Hz to 0.1 Hz, and the gain is less than 0.1 dB  2. Incompliance with ITU-T G.8273.2: band-pass feature. The low-side cutoff frequency ranges from 0.5 Hz to 0.1 Hz, and the high-side cutoff frequency ranges from 1 Hz to 1 Hz. The gain in the passband is less than 0.2 dB  3. Incompliance with ITU-T G.8273.2 section 7.4.1.2: When a SyncE ring network switching occurs, the output complies with the related profile (see Annex B). Other G.8273.2 specifications can be supported. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2K-B |
| The absolute time reference interface can be configured only when the BITS0 interface of the external BITS clock source is off and the signal type is 1pps input, dcls, or dcls input. This affects time synchronization.  You are advised to properly plan service configurations and do not use the BITS interface that functions as the absolute time reference interface as the BITS interface for output. Use other BITS interfaces for output. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| Due to hardware limitations, the following performance counters required by G.8273.2 cannot be supported by router hardware:  1. Incompliance with ITU-T G.8273.2 section 7.3.1: low-pass feature. The bandwidth ranges from 0.5 Hz to 0.1 Hz, and the gain is less than 0.1 dB  2. Incompliance with ITU-T G.8273.2: band-pass feature. The low-side cutoff frequency ranges from 0.5 Hz to 0.1 Hz, and the high-side cutoff frequency ranges from 1 Hz to 1 Hz. The gain in the passband is less than 0.2 dB  3. Incompliance with ITU-T G.8273.2 section 7.4.1.2: When a SyncE ring network switching occurs, the output complies with the related profile (see Annex B). Other G.8273.2 specifications can be supported. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2K-B |
| Routers' OTN colored optical interfaces support 1588v2. When routers and WDM devices are deployed on the same network, the 1588v2 synchronization performance is affected by the asymmetrical OLP single-ended switching optical fibers on intermediate WDM devices. As a result, the time synchronization performance is affected. Therefore, when OTN colored optical interfaces and WDM devices are deployed on the same network, 1588v2 does not support OLP single-ended switching on WDM devices. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2K-B |
| Restrictions on automatic asymmetric measurement on a ring network:  1. This function is applicable only to the scenario where a fiber on a ring network is broken and then repaired. The NE automatically measures the asymmetry value of the repaired fiber. This function does not apply to other scenarios, for example, the ring is broken to add new nodes. The asymmetry values in these scenarios must be manually measured.  2. Automatic measurement on a ring network is supported only when all devices on the ring network work in BC mode.  3. When performing ring network test on an NE, ensure that time out-of-lock or device reset does not occur on the NE and its upstream NEs. For example, a device is powered off, or warm/cold reset occurs on a board in use.  4. After an alarm indicating a fiber length change is reported on a device, check whether the fiber length changes and clear the alarm as soon as possible. Before the alarm is cleared, do not perform any operation that may cause a source switching (such as disabling an interface or modifying NE configurations) on the device.  5. This solution does not apply to the scenario where multiple points of failure occur and no backup path is available.  6. After an alarm indicating a fiber length change calculation failure is reported, manually measure the asymmetry value of the repaired fiber. The asymmetry value must be configured on the NE before the NE switches to the normal tracing path.  7. If the optical fiber in the transmit direction of the slave or passive port is faulty, the port does not change from Down to Up. In this case, automatic measurement is not supported.  It is recommended that you enable the ring-network automatic asymmetric measurement function according to the corresponding instructions. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| The slaveonly function and the static 1588v2 function are mutually exclusive on an OC, affecting time synchronization. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| If 1pps is specified as the type of imported signals, set the protocol standard with which TOD information complies to be the same as the signal type of the BITS0, BITS1, or BITS2 clock based on the type of the external BITS clock signals. Otherwise, time synchronization will be affected. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| Clock services do not support service VSs. (Clock services can be deployed only in the admin VS.) | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| The device supports only the performance indicators MAX|TE|, cTE, and dTE required by the G.8273.2 standard. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2K-B |
| PTP (1588v2/G.8275.1) and 1588 ACR client cannot be deployed on the same device.  Do not deploy PTP (1588v2/G.8275.1) and 1588 ACR client at the same time. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| The DCLS time information does not carry the leap second, and there is no standard to define the leap second. For devices connected using the DCLS protocol, the time displayed in the display ptp utc command output on the two devices has a fixed difference and is not synchronized. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| The O/E conversion module does not support 1588. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
