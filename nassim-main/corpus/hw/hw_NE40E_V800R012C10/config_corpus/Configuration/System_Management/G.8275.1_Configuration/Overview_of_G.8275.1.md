Overview of G.8275.1

#### Definition

ITU-T G.8275.1 is a precision time protocol telecom profile for phase/time synchronization with full timing support from the network based on the IEEE 1588v2 standard. It is implemented based on the 1588v2 hop-by-hop time synchronization solution that requires all devices on the link to support G.8275.1. As time synchronization is implemented based on frequency synchronization, G.8275.1 recommends that physical-layer clock synchronization be deployed for frequency synchronization.
