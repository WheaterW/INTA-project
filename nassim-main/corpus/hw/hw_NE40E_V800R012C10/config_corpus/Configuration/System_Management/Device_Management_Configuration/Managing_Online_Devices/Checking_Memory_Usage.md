Checking Memory Usage
=====================

During the routine maintenance of the device or when the device cannot run normally, you can check the memory usage and the memory usage configuration.

#### Procedure

* You can check the memory usage in any of the following methods:
  
  
  + Run the [**display memory-usage**](cmdqueryname=display+memory-usage) [ **slot** *slot-id* ] command to check the memory usage of a board.
  + Run the [**display memory-usage threshold**](cmdqueryname=display+memory-usage+threshold) [ **slot** *slot-id* ] command to check the memory usage threshold of a board.![](../../../../public_sys-resources/note_3.0-en-us.png) 
    
    You can run the [**set memory-usage threshold**](cmdqueryname=set+memory-usage+threshold) *threshold-value* [ **restore** *restore-threshold-value* ] [ **slot** *slot-id* ] command to set the thresholds for triggering and clearing memory usage alarms of a board.
