=================================================================

Software upgrade can optimize device performance and add new features.

#### Applicable Environment

To add new features or optimize device performance as needed, you can upgrade the current system software.

#### Pre-configuration Tasks

Before performing software upgrade that takes effect at the next startup, complete the following task:

* Logging in to a device to be upgraded


[Checking the System Before the Upgrade](../../../../software/nev8r10_vrpv8r16/user/vrp/dc_vrp_upgrade_cfg_0010.html)

The system must be checked against the checklist to ensure a smooth upgrade.

[Uploading the System Software](../../../../software/nev8r10_vrpv8r16/user/vrp/dc_vrp_upgrade_cfg_0011.html)

To add new features or optimize features on a device, upgrading the system software to the latest version is required. You need upload the system software before upgrading it.

[Specifying the System Software to Be Used at the Next Startup](../../../../software/nev8r10_vrpv8r16/user/vrp/dc_vrp_upgrade_cfg_0012.html)

Specifying the system software to be used at the next startup ensures that the device runs the new system software after being restarted.

[Restarting a Device](../../../../software/nev8r10_vrpv8r16/user/vrp/dc_vrp_upgrade_cfg_0013.html)

The specified system software to be used at the next startup will take effect only after the device is restarted.

[Verifying the Configuration of Software Upgrade that Takes Effect at the Next Startup](../../../../software/nev8r10_vrpv8r16/user/vrp/dc_vrp_upgrade_cfg_0014.html)

After specifying the system software to be used at the next startup, you can check whether the upgrade is successful.
