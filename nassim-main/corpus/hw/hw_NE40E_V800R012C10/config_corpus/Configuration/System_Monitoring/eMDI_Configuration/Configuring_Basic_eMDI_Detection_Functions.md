Configuring Basic eMDI Detection Functions
==========================================

This section describes how to configure basic eMDI detection functions to allow detection on the video traffic that passes through a node.

#### Usage Scenario

As a distributed board detection solution, eMDI depends on the establishment of a channel group and a board group and the binding of the channel group and board group. Besides, when the jitter indicator needs to be detected and the eMDI detection must be supported on Ps, jitter detection and P detection must be configured.

The channels to be detected need to be configured before the eMDI detection solution is used.

[Configuring an eMDI Board Group](../../../../software/nev8r10_vrpv8r16/user/ne/dc_ne_emdi_cfg_0004.html)

After an eMDI channel group is configured, configure a board group for eMDI detection.

[Binding a Channel Group to a Board Group](../../../../software/nev8r10_vrpv8r16/user/ne/dc_ne_emdi_cfg_0005.html)

After an eMDI channel group and a board group are created, bind the channel group to the board group to achieve eMDI distributed board detection.
