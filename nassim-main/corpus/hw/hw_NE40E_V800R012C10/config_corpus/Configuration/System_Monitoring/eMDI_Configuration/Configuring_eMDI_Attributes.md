Configuring eMDI Attributes
===========================

This section describes how to configure eMDI attributes after the basic eMDI detection functions are configured.

#### Usage Scenario

After basic eMDI detection functions are configured, configure eMDI related attributes. The monitoring period determines the frequency of eMDI detection. The alarm thresholds and the number of alarm suppression times determine the frequency of reporting eMDI alarms. The configuration of detection only on the rate of video streams ensures the accuracy of detection indicators on the NG MVPN network where the transit and bud nodes overlap.
