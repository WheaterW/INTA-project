Configuration Precautions for NetStream

#### Feature Requirements

**Table 1** Feature requirements
| Feature Requirements | Series | Models |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1. In tunnel sampling scenarios where traffic leaves a GRE tunnel, if the traffic forwarding mode is hardware switching or software loopback, sampling is not supported.  2. If sampling is required, you need to configure hardware loopback on the GRE tunnel interface. After hardware loopback is configured, the forwarding performance of all GRE tunnels is reduced by half. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| In an L3VPN over SRv6 TE Policy scenario, if the outbound interface is a QinQ sub-interface/dot1q VLAN tag termination interface and slicing is deployed, the IP next hop and BGP next hop cannot be displayed in downstream sampling. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |

| If the outbound interface of a route is found based on the source IP address and used as the inbound interface for downstream sampling, the outbound interface may be different from that of the actual traffic. If the outbound interface of a route cannot be found based on the source IP address, the inbound interface can only be restored to the physical main interface of the actual inbound interface or the physical member interface of the trunk interface. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |

QinQ forwarding  3. 6to4/4to6 tunnel  4. GRE/MGRE  5. VXLAN  6. BRAS scenarios  7. SRv6 TE Policy scenarios | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| When NetStream works with CGN, if inbound sampling is configured and the sampling packet type is original packet, destination VPN, outbound interface, and destination route information cannot be collected if inbound-interface, outbound-interface, IPv4 route, or IPv6 route-based traffic diversion is configured. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |

| In an L2VPN/EVPN over SRv6 tunnel scenario, inner packet sampling does not take effect on a transit node. After inner packet sampling is enabled, the transit node still samples packets based on outer packets. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| 1. In an L2VPN/EVPN L2VPN over SRv6 tunnel scenario, sampling is not supported in the network-side outbound direction of the ingress and egress.  2. In an L2VPN/EVPN L2VPN over SRv6 tunnel scenario, sampling is supported in the network-side inbound direction of the ingress and egress. The ipv6 netstream srv6-aware inner-header command fails to take effect after being run, and outer packets are still sampled. In addition, information about the outbound interface (displayed as Unknown), next hop (displayed as 0.0.0.0), BGP next hop (displayed as 0.0.0.0), BGP AS number (displayed as 0), and mask (displayed as 0) cannot be obtained. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| In an L2VPN/EVPN L2VPN over SRv6 tunnel scenario, after inbound interface sampling is configured on the AC interface of the ingress and the public network interface of the egress, the outbound interface (Unknown), next hop (0.0.0.0), BGP next hop (0.0.0.0), BGP AS number (0), and mask (0) cannot be obtained. When outbound interface sampling is configured, the inbound interface (Unknown), next hop (0.0.0.0), BGP next hop (0.0.0.0), BGP AS number (0), and mask (0) cannot be obtained. In this case, SRv6 sampling results are affected. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| In SRv6 scenarios, information about packets with more than two layers of IPv6+SRH headers or packets with more than two layers of SRH headers following the IPv6 header cannot be collected.  A reference packet format is as follows:  IPv6+SRH+IPv6+SRH+IPv6+SRH+PayLoad or IPv6+SRH+SRH+SRH+Payload. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| SRv6 sampling results are affected in the following network slicing scenarios:  1. The basic interface and slice interface are different physical interfaces in a FlexE group, and outbound interface sampling is configured. When traffic enters through the slice interface, the inbound interface for sampling is restored to the main interface where the slice interface resides.  2. In the scenario where the basic interface is a physical main interface and the slice interface is a channelized sub-interface, after outbound interface sampling is configured, the inbound interface for sampling is restored to the basic interface when traffic enters through the slice interface. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |

The display of SrcIf is related to the encapsulation source-address command configuration.  1. If the configured source-address corresponds to an interface, SrcIf is displayed as the interface.  2. If the configured source-address does not correspond to any interface, the interface displayed in the SrcIf field is incorrect. The interface may be any physical, NULL0, or unknown interface on the sampling board. BGPnexthop is displayed as ::, and DstAs is 0.  3.

When outbound interface sampling is configured on the SFF, the values of NextHop, BgpNextHop, and DstAs are inaccurate. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| In an IP over SRv6 service chain scenario, SRv6 sampling results are affected in the following situation: In the SF -> SFF scenario, when inbound interface sampling is performed on the SFF for traffic from the SF, DstIf is displayed as UnKnown, and inaccurate values are displayed in the NextHop and BgpNextHop fields. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |

| 1. In End.X PSP scenarios where an SRv6 TE Policy in encap or insert mode crosses Policy P nodes (including Sid, ShortCut, EPE, etc.) or in End.X Usd scenarios where traffic leaves a tunnel, when inbound interface sampling is performed, NextHop and DstAS information is incorrectly collected. When the actual outbound interface is different from the outbound interface in the routing information of the last-level SID, outbound interface (DstIf) information is incorrectly collected, affecting SRv6 sampling results. During outbound interface sampling, inbound interface (SrcIf) information may be incorrectly collected, and the NextHop and DstAS information is incorrectly collected.  2. In SRv6 slicing scenarios where downstream sampling is performed (endx, reduce endx, and tefrr are popped out on the penultimate hop), because the upstream NP removes the End.X SID, which cannot be obtained during downstream sampling, only the next-layer SID can be used to query reindex, causing information such as the next hop to be incorrectly obtained. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |

| Sampling for communication between Option B SRv6 and MPLS:  1. In the SRv6 -> MPLS direction, the inbound interface restored for outbound interface sampling is the main interface. The outbound interface restored for inbound interface sampling is the main interface. The sampling data of the next hop and BGP next hop is 0.  2. In the MPLS -> SRv6 direction, the inbound interface restored for outbound interface sampling is the main interface. The sampling data of the next hop and BGP next hop is 0. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| After the upgrade, the 16-bit NSIndex is dynamically allocated to interfaces on the device. The NSIndex allocated to each interface may change. The sampling server needs to synchronize the mapping between the interface index and NSIndex on the device. Otherwise, the sampling server may fail to restore interface traffic based on the NSIndex before the upgrade. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
