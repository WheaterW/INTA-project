Configuring Performance Measurement based on Static IFIT Flows
==============================================================

After performance measurement based on static IFIT flows is configured, you can obtain packet loss and delay information across the network through end-to-end measurement. This allows you to promptly adjust services when network performance deteriorates. You can also accurately locate the network node where a performance fault occurs through hop-by-hop measurement.

#### Pre-configuration Tasks

Before configuring performance measurement based on static IFIT flows, complete the following tasks:

* Configure a dynamic routing protocol or static routes so that devices are reachable at the network layer.
* Configure the network time protocol or G.8275.1 to implement clock synchronization for all devices that have clocks on the network.
