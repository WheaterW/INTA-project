Overview of ESQM

#### Definition

Enhanced stream quality monitoring (ESQM) collects information about Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP), or GPRS Tunneling Protocol (GTP) packets on a board through which the packets pass based on 5-tuple information (source and destination IP addresses, source and destination port numbers, and transport layer protocol). The collected information includes the packet type, timestamp, inbound and outbound interfaces, VPN, and packet statistics. The information is reported to the Huawei controller system for forwarding path restoration, traffic restoration, or fault detection.


#### Purpose

Traditional communication networks are unable to "perceive" services, preventing customers' ever-changing service requirements from being responded to in real time. To solve this problem, ESQM has been developed to help devices monitor the quality of services on networks. This technology integrates network deployment with service requirements and provides the data that is the foundation for automatic and intelligent network lifecycle management.


#### Benefits

ESQM offers the following benefits:

* Helps communication networks perceive service quality, and enables devices to proactively detect services with poor QoE for fault diagnosis, demarcation, and service optimization, thereby effectively shortening the duration of network interruptions and reducing customers' OPEX.
* Helps customers perceive networks according to multiple metrics, including service quality, forwarding path, and load, providing data support for routine maintenance and network optimization.
