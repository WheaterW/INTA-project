Configuration Precautions for ESQM

#### Feature Requirements

**Table 1** Feature requirements
| Feature Requirements | Series | Models |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ESQM does not support flow identification based on VPN and inbound/outbound interface information. A device regards the flows with the same quintuple information (source and destination IP addresses, source and destination port numbers, and protocol number) and monitoring direction (inbound or outbound) as one flow for statistics collection, even if the inbound/outbound interfaces and VPNs of the flows are different. Avoid this scenario during service planning. Otherwise, the statistics about the flows in this scenario are combined. As a result, the monitoring results are inaccurate. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| The ESQM function and MAC address table share resources. When the number of MAC address entries reaches the maximum, no ESQM flow table can be created. Similarly, when the number of ESQM flow entries reaches the upper limit, the number of MAC address entries cannot reach the upper limit. Avoid this scenario during service planning. Otherwise, the specifications of the MAC address table and ESQM flow table affect each other and cannot reach the full specifications at the same time. When the MAC address table usage is high, an alarm is generated. The default threshold is 90%. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| ESQM conflicts with NetStream, sFlow, flow discovery, and ACL log and cannot be configured together. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| ESQM collects only the traffic forwarded by the device. It does not collect statistics about discarded traffic or local traffic. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| ESQM creates flow tables in hash mode. Due to uneven hash, the flow table cannot be created in full specifications. When traffic of the full specification enters the device, the minimum number of created flows is 80% of the specification considering uneven hash. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| ESQM can detect packets on Ethernet interfaces (including Ethernet main interfaces and sub-interfaces), Ethernet Trunk main interfaces, Trunk sub-interfaces, L3VE sub-interfaces, QinQ termination sub-interfaces, dot1q termination sub-interfaces, and VLANIF interfaces. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| ESQM can detect packets on FlexEth interfaces.  ESQM is not supported in heterogeneous-media scenarios. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| When GTP heartbeat packets are transmitted between two devices, the two devices proactively report their own traffic monitoring information to the controller. Due to the receive time difference, the statistics (number of packets and bytes) from the two devices may have a deviation of less than 1%. Configure an error packet detection threshold on the controller. IFIT measurement is triggered only after the threshold is exceeded. Otherwise, the measurement information is inaccurate, incorrectly triggering measurement. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2K-B |
| ESQM is not supported in NAT scenarios. This scenario must be avoided during service planning. Otherwise, the collected information is inaccurate. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| ESQM is not supported in P2MP TE and NG MVPN scenarios. This scenario must be avoided during service planning. Otherwise, the collected information is inaccurate and false alarms may be reported. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| When subsequent packets of TCP data flows are collected, there is a possibility that the packets cannot be reported to the controller in the sequence in which they are received. The error rate is within 0.01%. Configure an error packet detection threshold on the controller. IFIT measurement is triggered only after the threshold is exceeded. Otherwise, the controller incorrectly considers the packets as retransmitted packets, causing inaccurate measurement results. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2K-B |
| The transmit node does not support the ESQM function. In this scenario, the collected information is inaccurate. As a result, a false alarm is reported. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| ESQM cannot be performed for packets on the BRAS user-side interface. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| ESQM is not supported for fragmented packets. This scenario must be avoided during service planning. Otherwise, the collected traffic statistics are inconsistent with the actual traffic statistics because fragmented packets are not counted. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| ESQM can be performed only for common IPv4 packets and IPv4 in MPLS packets. In other scenarios, traffic restoration information is inaccurate, which needs to be avoided during service planning. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| In a path switchover scenario, the reported TTL value may be different from the actual value. The TTL value of a TCP/SCTP packet is obtained when the first packet is used to create a flow. The TTL value is related to the number of nodes on the path. After path switching, the new TTL value of a node may be different from the TTL value obtained when the first packet is used to create a flow. Before a flow table is aged out, only subsequent packets (excluding TTL information) are sent to the CPU, and the TTL value cannot be updated. Therefore, when a flow table is aged out, only the TTL value used when the flow table is created can be sent to the CPU. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| ESQM is not supported in multi-VS scenarios. Avoid this scenario during service planning. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| When upstream ESQM is configured, the inbound interface can be restored only to the main interface. When downstream ESQM is configured, the outbound interface can be restored only to the main interface. The controller cannot display paths at the sub-interface granularity. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| When the 1588 clock is not configured or unlocked, the timestamp reported to the controller is inaccurate. As a result, the controlelr incorrectly collects delay statistics and triggers IFIT measurement. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2K-B |
| In deep load balancing scenarios, GTP heartbeat packets and data packets are balanced to different paths based on different tunnel IDs. As a result, statistics are inaccurate. You are advised to disable deep load balancing. Otherwise, the statistics are inaccurate, causing the controller to incorrectly perform measurement, hence incorrectly triggering IFIT measurement. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2K-B |
| When the same flow enters and leaves the same node through multiple interfaces, the key information in the flow table does not contain interface information. Therefore, the scenario where the same flow enters from different interfaces cannot be distinguished. As a result, statistics about the flow is collected multiple times, and the traffic statistics reported by ESQM are doubled. You can deploy ESQM on the ingress and egress to avoid this problem. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
