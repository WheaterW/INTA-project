Configuring VTY User Interfaces
===============================

VTY user interfaces manage and monitor users who log in to a router using VTY.

#### Usage Scenario

To log in to a router using Telnet or SSH for local or remote configuration and maintenance, configure VTY user interfaces, including the maximum number of VTY user interfaces, limit on incoming and outgoing calls, terminal attributes, user levels, and authentication modes. You can configure parameters based on use and security requirements.

#### Pre-configuration Tasks

Before configuring VTY user interfaces, log in to a Router through a console port.


[Configuring the Maximum Number of VTY User Interfaces](../../../../software/nev8r10_vrpv8r16/user/vrp/dc_vrp_basic_cfg_0014.html)

You can configure the maximum number of VTY user interfaces to limit the number of concurrent login users.

[Configuring the Limit on Incoming and Outgoing Calls for a VTY User Interface](../../../../software/nev8r10_vrpv8r16/user/vrp/dc_vrp_basic_cfg_0015.html)

An access control list (ACL) can be configured to limit incoming and outgoing calls for a VTY user interface.

[Configuring Terminal Attributes for a VTY User Interface](../../../../software/nev8r10_vrpv8r16/user/vrp/dc_vrp_basic_cfg_0016.html)

Terminal attributes of a VTY user interface include the timeout period of an idle connection, number of rows displayed on a terminal screen, and buffer size for historical commands.

[Configuring a User Level for a VTY User Interface](../../../../software/nev8r10_vrpv8r16/user/vrp/dc_vrp_basic_cfg_0017.html)

To improve security, configure user levels for user interfaces to manage users based on their levels. This section describes how to configure a user level for a VTY user interface.

[Configuring an Authentication Mode for a VTY User Interface](../../../../software/nev8r10_vrpv8r16/user/vrp/dc_vrp_basic_cfg_0018.html)

The system provides AAA authentication and password authentication to improve system security.

[Configure an Alarm Threshold for the Number of Available VTY Channels](../../../../software/nev8r10_vrpv8r16/user/vrp/dc_vrp_user-interface_0145.html)

By configuring an alarm threshold for the number available VTY channels, you can know information about available VTY channels on a device in a timely manner.

[Enabling the VTY User Interface's Security Policy](../../../../software/nev8r10_vrpv8r16/user/vrp/dc_vrp_basic_cfg_0144.html)

This section describes how to enable the VTY user interface's security policy. It is recommended that you enable the security policy to harden the VTY user interface's security.

[Verifying the Configuration of VTY User Interfaces](../../../../software/nev8r10_vrpv8r16/user/vrp/dc_vrp_basic_cfg_0020.html)

After configuring a VTY user interface, verify the configuration.
