Editing an Intermediate File
============================

Editing an Intermediate File

#### Procedure

1. An intermediate file can be an .ini file, a .cfg file, or a Python script file. The .ini and .cfg files have low requirements and are easy to configure, whereas Python script files have high requirements on users. Therefore, for the users who use ZTP for the first time, it is recommended that an .ini or .cfg file be selected as the intermediate file. For details about related file formats, see [Intermediate File in the INI Format](dc_ne_ztp_feature_0005.html), [Intermediate File in the CFG Format](dc_ne_ztp_feature_0011.html), or [Intermediate Files in the Python Format](dc_ne_ztp_feature_0006_1.html).
