ZTP Configuration
=================

Zero touch provisioning (ZTP) can be used to automatically deploy unconfigured devices after they are powered on.

#### Context

ZTP enables you to automatically deploy unconfigured devices after they are powered on, thereby improving deployment efficiency in scenarios where many devices need to be deployed.

In VS mode, this feature is supported only by the admin VS.
