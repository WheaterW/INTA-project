Command Display Mode
====================

All commands have the same display feature. You can flexibly specify a display mode as required.

#### Command Output Display

When the command output cannot be completely displayed on one screen, you can use the pause function to view the information on the current screen, before moving onto the next screen. [Table 1](#EN-US_CONCEPT_0172359718__tab_dc_vrp_cli_cfg_001301) describes the available display functions.

**Table 1** Display functions
| Key | Function |
| --- | --- |
| Space bar | Continues to display the information on the next screen. |
| Enter | Continues to display the information in the next line. |
| + *regular-expression* | Provides the same function as **| include** *regular-expression*. |
| - *regular-expression* | Provides the same function as **| exclude** *regular-expression*. |
| / *regular-expression* | Provides the same function as **| begin** *regular-expression*. |
| **Ctrl**+**C** and any other key except the preceding ones | Stops information display and command execution. |
