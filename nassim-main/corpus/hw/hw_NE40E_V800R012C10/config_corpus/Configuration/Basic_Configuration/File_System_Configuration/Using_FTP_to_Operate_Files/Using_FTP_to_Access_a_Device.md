Using FTP to Access a Device
============================

After an FTP server is configured, you can access the server from a PC by using FTP to manage files on the server.

#### Context

To log in to the FTP server from the PC, use either the Windows Command Prompt or third-party software. Use the Windows Command Prompt as an example.

Perform the following steps on the PC:


#### Procedure

1. Enter the Windows Command Prompt window.
2. Run the **ftp** *ip-address* command to log in to the server by using FTP.
   
   
   
   Enter the user name and password at the prompt, and press **Enter**. If the command prompt of the FTP client view, **ftp>** for example, is displayed, you have entered the working path of the FTP server.
