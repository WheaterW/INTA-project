Operating Files After Logging In to a Device
============================================

You can operate files after logging in to a device, including managing a storage component, directories, and files.

#### Usage Scenario

When a device fails to save or obtain data, you can log in to the device to repair the faulty storage component or manage files or directories on the device.

This file operation mode is used when a storage component needs to be managed.


#### Pre-configuration Tasks
