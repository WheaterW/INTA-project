Enabling or Disabling the Optical Module Laser
==============================================

This section describes how to enable or disable the optical module laser.

#### Usage Scenario

Before locating or troubleshooting a link failure, maintenance engineers should ensure that the optical module laser is disabled so that it cannot cause injury. The optical module can be configured to disable the laser automatically if it detects a link failure. The laser can also be disabled manually. If the optical module is configured to disable the laser automatically, the laser is not immediately re-enabled when the link failure is cleared. However, maintenance engineers can enable the optical module laser manually to check whether services have recovered.


#### Pre-configuration Tasks

Before enabling or disabling the optical module laser, complete the following tasks:

* Power on the Router and ensure that the Router passes the self-check.
* Ensure that the optical module has been installed and that the interface is Up.

Disabling the optical module laser before troubleshooting a link failure protects maintenance engineers from the laser.
