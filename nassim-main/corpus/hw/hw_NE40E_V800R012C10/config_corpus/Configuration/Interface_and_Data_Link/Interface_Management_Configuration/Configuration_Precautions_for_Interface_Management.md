| --- | --- | --- |
| After an ETM subcard is removed and then inserted or reset, downstream channelized sub-interface statistics are lost, but unicast, multicast, and broadcast statistics still exist. You need to run the reset counters interface command to clear the statistics. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| Dual-stack statistics collection on VLANIF interfaces does not support multicast statistics collection. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| During an independent NP reset, the VE interface status does not change accordingly, and services that depend on the VE interface status change do not take effect. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| For Ethernet and Eth-Trunk interfaces, channelized sub-interfaces support only VLAN-type dot1q sub-interfaces and QinQ VLAN tag termination sub-interfaces.  For POS interfaces, channelized sub-interfaces support only POS FR sub-interfaces.  Other types of main interfaces do not support channelized sub-interfaces. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| 1. If the number of FlexE physical interfaces, FlexE physical interface numbers, FlexE number ranges and groups, and FlexE sub-timeslot granularity capabilities are the same before and after the replacement, the FlexE configuration is retained after the replacement.  2. If the new board or subcard does not support FlexE, the existing FlexE configuration on the board or subcard will be deleted.  3. If the original subcard is configured with a 1.25 Gbit/s FlexE sub-timeslot granularity and the new subcard does not support the 1.25 Gbit/s FlexE sub-timeslot granularity, all FlexE configurations except the timeslot or bandwidth mode on the subcard will be deleted.  4. If a pass-through or non-pass-through card is replaced, the existing FlexE configuration will be deleted.  5. If the port ID used by a FlexE client is not supported after the replacement, the FlexE client and FlexE interface will be deleted.  6. If a FlexE physical interface bound to a FlexE group does not exist, does not support FlexE, or cannot be bound to each other after the replacement, the FlexE group, FlexE clients created in the FlexE group, and FlexE interfaces will be deleted.  7. In subcard replacement scenarios, if the number of FlexE clients created in the FlexE group to which the bound FlexE physical interfaces belong exceeds the capability of the new board or subcard, the interface with a larger port ID in the FlexE clients is preferentially deleted. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| The commands used to query information about interfaces do not support offline interfaces. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| The interface fixed index function is dependent on device.sys files. When the data in device.sys files is deleted, the interface index may change after the device restart. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |

You can run the set service-mode card-bandwidth-mode command to switch the bandwidth working mode of an interface. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2H |
| Restrictions on fixed interfaces of a device:  1, When renaming a 10GE interface as an XGE interface is enabled:  a, When the 28x10GE mode is switched to the 26x10GE+18xGE mode and the undo shutdown command is run on interface 26 or 27, a message indicating the undo shutdown configuration error is displayed.  b, When the 26x10GE+18xGE mode is switched to the 28x10GE mode and the undo shutdown command is run on any of interfaces 26 to 43, a message indicating the undo shutdown configuration error is displayed.  c, When the 28x10GE mode is switched to the 20x10GE+24xGE mode and the undo shutdown command is run on any of interfaces 20 to 27, a message indicating the undo shutdown configuration error is displayed.  d, When the 26x10GE+18xGE mode is switched to the 20x10GE+24xGE mode and the undo shutdown command is run on any of interfaces 20 to 25, a message indicating the undo shutdown configuration error is displayed.  e, When the 20x10GE+24xGE mode is switched to the 28x10GE mode and the undo shutdown command is run on any of interfaces 20 to 43, a message indicating the undo shutdown configuration error is displayed.  f, When the 20x10GE+24xGE mode is switched to the 26x10GE+18xGE mode and the undo shutdown command is run on any of interfaces 20 to 25, a message indicating the undo shutdown configuration error is displayed.  2, When renaming a 10GE interface as an XGE interface is disabled:  a, When the 28x10GE mode is switched to the 26x10GE+18xGE mode and the undo shutdown command is run on interface 26 or 27 that has no autonegotiation or is not forcibly set to 1GE mode, a message indicating the undo shutdown configuration error is displayed.  b, When the 26x10GE+18xGE mode is switched to the 28x10GE mode and the undo shutdown command is run on interface 26 or 27 on which no 1G optical module is inserted or on any of interfaces 28 to 43, a message indicating the undo shutdown configuration error is displayed.  c, When the 28x10GE mode is switched to the 20x10GE+24xGE mode and the undo shutdown command is run on any of interfaces 20 to 27 that has no autonegotiation or is not forcibly set to 1GE mode, a message indicating the undo shutdown configuration error is displayed.  d, When the 26x10GE+18xGE mode is switched to the 20x10GE+24xGE mode and the undo shutdown command is run on any of interfaces 20 to 25 that has no autonegotiation or is not forcibly set to 1GE mode, a message indicating the undo shutdown configuration error is displayed.  e. When the 20x10G+24xGE mode is switched to the 28x10G mode and the undo shutdown command is run on any of interfaces 20 to 27 on which no 1G optical module is installed or on any of interfaces 28 to 43 that has or does not have optical modules, a prompt message indicating undo shutdown errors is displayed.  f. When the 20x10G+24xGE mode is switched to the 26x10G+18xGE mode and the undo shutdown command is run on any of interfaces 20 to 25 that has no autonegotiation or is not forcibly set to the 1G port mode, a prompt message indicating undo shutdown errors is displayed.  Impact:  Services are prevented from being interrupted without any restrictions.  Workarounds:  1, When renaming a 10GE interface as an XGE interface is enabled:  a, Shut down interfaces 26 and 27 before switching the 28x10G mode to the 26x10G+18xGE mode.  b, Shut down interfaces 26-43 before switching the 26x10G+18xGE mode to the 28x10G mode.  c, Shut down interfaces 20 to 27 before switching the 28x10G mode to the 20x10G+24xGE mode.  d, Shut down interfaces 20 to 25 before switching the 26x10G+18xGE mode to the 20x10G+24xGE mode.  e, Shut down interfaces 20 to 43 before switching the 20x10G+24xGE mode to the 28x10G mode.  f, Shut down interfaces 20 to 25 before switching the 20x10G+24xGE mode to the 26x10G+18xGE mode.  2, When renaming a 10GE interface as an XGE interface is disabled:  a, Shut down interface 26 or 27 that has no autonegotiation or is not forcibly set to the 1G interface mode before switching the 28x10G mode to the 26x10G+18xGE mode.  b, Shut down interface 26 or 27 that has no 1G optical module and shut down interfaces 28 to 43 before switching the 26x10G+18xGE mode to the 28x10G mode.  c, Shut down interfaces 20 to 27 that have no autonegotiation or are not forcibly set to the 1G interface mode before switching the 28x10G mode to the 20x10G+24xGE mode.  d, Shut down interfaces 20 to 25 that have no autonegotiation or are not forcibly set to the 1G interface mode before switching the 26x10G+18xGE mode to the 20x10G+24xGE mode.  e, Shut down interfaces 20 to 27 that have no 1G optical module and shut down interfaces 28 to 43 before switching the 20x10G+24xGE mode to the 28x10G mode.  f, Shut down interfaces 20 to 25 that have no autonegotiation or are not forcibly set to the 1G interface mode before switching the 20x10G+24xGE mode to the 26x10G+18xGE mode.  You can run the set service-mode card-bandwidth-mode command to switch the bandwidth working mode of an interface. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2H |
| 10GE ports 2 to 21 on the fixed board work only in LAN mode. LAN/WAN switching and 10GE/GE switching are performed.  LAN/WAN switching and 10GE/GE switching are performed on interfaces 22 to 27 of the fixed board. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2K |
| To switch the bandwidth mode of a fixed card, check the following interface restrictions:  1. When the 2x100GE+30x10GF+10xGE mode is switched to the 2x100GE+26x10GF+14xGE mode:  1) When renaming a 10GE interface as an XGE interface is enabled:  When the undo shudown command is run on any of the interfaces numbered from 28 to 31, the system displays a message indicating that the undo shutdown command is incorrect.  When any of the interfaces numbered from 28 to 31 is added to a VS, an error message is displayed, indicating that the interface is added to the VS.  If any of the interfaces numbered from 28 to 31 is configured with a clock, a message is displayed, indicating that the interface has a clock configuration error.  2) When renaming a 10GE interface as an XGE interface is disabled:  When the rate of interfaces 28 to 31 is not auto-negotiated to 1 Gbit/s or is not forcibly set to 1 Gbit/s, and the undo shudown command is run on any of the interfaces, a prompt message indicating undo shutdown errors is displayed.  If interfaces numbered from 28 to 31 do not automatically work at the rate of 1 Gbit/s or are not forcibly configured to work at the rate of 1 Gbit/s. When any of the interfaces is added to a VS, an error message is displayed, indicating that an interface is added to the VS.  2. When the 2x100GE+26x10GF+14xGE mode is switched to the 2x100GE+30x10GF+10xGE mode:  1) When renaming a 10GE interface as an XGE interface is enabled:  When the undo shudown command is run on any of the interfaces numbered from 28 to 31, the system displays a message indicating that the undo shutdown command is incorrect.  When any of the interfaces numbered from 28 to 31 is added to a VS, an error message is displayed, indicating that the interface is added to the VS.  If any of the interfaces numbered from 28 to 31 is configured with a clock, a message is displayed, indicating that the interface has a clock configuration error.  2) When renaming a 10GE interface as an XGE interface is disabled:  When interfaces 28 to 31 do not have 1G optical modules installed and the undo shudown command is run on any of the interfaces, a message is displayed, indicating that the undo shutdown command is incorrect.  If interfaces 28 to 31 do not have 1G optical modules installed and any of them is added to a VS, an error message is displayed, indicating that an interface is added to the VS. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2K |
| To switch the bandwidth mode of a fixed subcard, check the following restrictions on the subcard:  1. When the 2x100GE+30x10GF+10xGE mode is switched to the 2x100GE+26x10GF+14xGE mode: Check whether any registered subcard in the flexible slot is incompatible with the 2x100GE+26x10GF+14xGE mode. If yes, prompt the user to power off the incompatible subcard.  2. When the 2x100GE+26x10GF+14xGE mode is switched to the 2x100GE+30x10GF+10xGE mode: Check whether any registered subcard in the flexible slot is incompatible with the 2x100GE+30x10GF+10xGE mode. If yes, prompt the user to power off the incompatible subcard. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2K |
| When switching the working rate of a 25GE interface on a CR5D00E4XM25 subcard, pay attention to the following restrictions:  Before switching the working rate (including manual and adaptive bandwidth switching modes), check whether the interface is added to a VS. If the interface is added to a VS, the bandwidth mode cannot be switched. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2K |
| 100GE interfaces on the CR5D00E1NC98 subcard are split. After the configuration is delivered, the subcard needs to be powered off and then powered on for the configuration to take effect. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2K |
| 100GE interfaces on the CR5D00E1NC98 subcard are split. The configuration restrictions are as follows:  1. After interface splitting is configured or canceled, the configuration takes effect immediately and the original interface configuration is lost. Therefore, exercise caution when performing this operation.  2. Before executing the interface splitting configuration, check whether the interface whose configuration needs to be deleted is added to a VS. If an interface is added to a VS, the interface splitting configuration cannot be executed. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2K |
| 100GE interfaces on the CR5D00E1NC98 subcard are split on the device. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2H |
| 1. The default rate of a GE electrical interface is 1000 Mbit/s and the interface works in auto-negotiation mode. You can forcibly change the rate, but ensure that the rate is the same as that of the peer end. When the rate is set to 10 Mbit/s or 100 Mbit/s, the auto-negotiation mode is canceled.  2. After an Ethernet electrical interface is removed from a GE interface card with both optical and electrical interfaces and an Ethernet optical interface is inserted into the interface card, the system automatically clears the configuration commands related to the electrical interface on the electrical interface. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| 1, When a physical interface in flexible Ethernet (FlexE) mode joins a FlexE group, services on all the FlexE interfaces in the FlexE group are intermittently interrupted, which lasts 50 ms.  2, When a physical interface in FlexE mode exits from a FlexE group, services on all the FlexE interfaces in the FlexE group are intermittently interrupted. Services on the FlexE interfaces that use timeslots of the physical interface are interrupted for 200 ms. Services on the FlexE interfaces that do not use timeslots of the physical interface are interrupted for 50 ms. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K |
| 1. Before configuring the GE optical/electrical interface mode, delete all configurations on the interface.  2. After an Ethernet electrical interface is removed from an 8-port 100/1000Base-X-SFP service interface card and an Ethernet optical interface is inserted into the interface card, the system automatically clears the configuration commands related to the electrical interface. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| XGE interfaces are under PAF control. A 10GE interface is renamed as an XGE interface after the PAF is installed on the device and the device is restarted. The original 10GE interface configurations are lost, and reconfiguration needs to be performed on the XGE interface. After the AP for interface extension is installed with the PAF and restarted, if the external communication interface is a 10GE interface, the external communication interface needs to be reconfigured. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| When SQ-based rate limiting is configured on an eTM subcard and the traffic rate exceeds the SQ bandwidth, statistics about outgoing traffic on the interface are inaccurate. In this case, statistics about outgoing traffic on the sub-interface are greater than the actual traffic statistics after rate limiting.  You can run the "display port-queue statistics interface" {<interface-type interface-number> | <interface-name>} [<cos-value>] "outbound" command to obtain the actual statistics about outgoing traffic. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| When a router is directly connected to a non-Huawei device, if the router is powered off and restarted and sends signals immediately after the interface is initialized, some data may be lost because the configuration restoration of the router is not complete.  To prevent this problem, run the port-tx-enabling-delay <port-tx-delay-time> command in the interface view to enable the interface to send signals after a delay and set the delay. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| When VPN QoS is configured for a VSI or VLL, a channelized sub-interface cannot be created for the VS.  After a channelized sub-interface is created, VPN QoS cannot be configured for any VSI or VLL of the VS. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| For the CR5D0E5XMF94/CR5DE2NE4X14 subcard:  1. When interface 0 works in FlexE mode, the 40GE optical module works in auto-sensing mode.  2. In 2\*50GE interface mode and auto-sensing mode, interface 0 automatically switches to the 40GE mode after a 40GE optical module is installed, and interface 1 is deleted. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| The following OTN subcards (or subcards supporting the OTN mode) do not support OTN delay measurement: (1) The sink end does not support delay measurement enabling. (2) The source end does not support delay measurement initiation.  CR5D00E1NC98 | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K |
| On eTM boards and subcards, when the egress traffic on a channelized sub-interface exceeds the configured bandwidth of the channelized sub-interface, the egress traffic is limited to the bandwidth of the channelized sub-interface. In this case, the number of packets, the number of bytes, and the rate in the outbound direction are incorrect. However, the statistics on unicast, broadcast, multicast, and IPv4/IPv6 dual-stack traffic are the egress traffic before the rate limit. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| A 50G or 100G interface automatically configures an FEC mode based on the type of the installed optical module to ensure normal service running. If the FEC modes of multiple FlexE physical interfaces in a FlexE group are different, an hwFlexEGrpFecModeMismatch alarm is reported. After the alarm is generated, the FEC configuration on the interface remains unchanged even if the optical module is removed. In this case, the alarm cannot be cleared.  To clear the alarm, perform the following steps:  Install an optical module with the same FEC mode.  Delete the physical interfaces with different FEC modes.  Run the fec-eth command to configure the same FEC mode for the interfaces. (Only 100G interfaces support this command. If the optical module does not match the FEC mode, services on the interfaces may be affected.) | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| The display counters rate command displays only the rates at which interfaces in Up state send and receive packets. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| After IP address conflict detection is disabled and the preemption function for conflicting IP addresses is enabled:  1. If the preemption function for conflicting IP addresses is disabled, the same IP address may take effect on a different interface after a device restart.  2. The preemption function for conflicting IP addresses does not take effect for VRRP virtual addresses.  3. If the IP address of the source interface specified for a service takes effect on another interface with a higher priority, the protocol status of the source interface is Down, which may cause service interruption.  4. After a conflicting IP address takes effect on an interface with a higher priority, traffic may be temporarily interrupted due to interface switchover. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| The remaining bandwidth of a main interface displays only the traffic rate of the main interface and does not include the traffic rate of sub-interfaces (regardless of channelized and non-channelized sub-interfaces).  For example, the channelized sub-interface GigabitEthernet 2/1/11.1 is created on the physical interface GigabitEthernet 2/1/11 that is configured with an IP address and carries services. In this case, the remaining bandwidth of the channelized main interface queried on the physical interface is the rate of traffic carried on the physical interface. If a non-channelized sub-interface GE 2/1/11.2 is created (this scenario does not exist), the remaining bandwidth of the channelized main interface queried on the physical interface is still the rate of traffic carried on the physical interface and does not include the traffic rate of the non-channelized sub-interface GE 2/1/11.2.  The corresponding query command is as follows:  display interface GigabitEthernet2/1/11 externsive  Remaining bandwidth deducted from channelized sub-interface: 1000 Mbits/sec  Last 300 seconds input remaining rate: 5000 bits/sec, 200 packets/sec  Last 300 seconds output remaining rate: 5000 bits/sec, 200 packets/sec  Input remaining bandwidth utilization: 0.00%  Output remaining bandwidth utilization: 0.00% | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| Statistics about downstream protocol packets are not collected on VE main interfaces (including global VE main interfaces). Cause: Downstream protocol packets are transparently transmitted in the forwarding process and cannot be collected on the forwarding plane. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
