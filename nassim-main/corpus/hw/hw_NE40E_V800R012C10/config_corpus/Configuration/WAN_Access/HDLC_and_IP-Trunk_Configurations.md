HDLC and IP-Trunk Configurations
================================

High-Level Data Link Control (HDLC) is a bit-oriented link layer protocol used to transparently transmit all types of bit flows. An IP-Trunk consists of Packet over SDH/SONET (POS) links and is encapsulated with HDLC at the data link layer. The IP-Trunk increases interface bandwidth and improves link reliability.

[Overview](../../../../software/nev8r10_vrpv8r16/user/vrp/dc_vrp_hdlc_ip-trunk_cfg_0001.html)

As a bit-oriented link layer protocol, HDLC transparently transmits bit flows of any type without specifying data as a set of characters.

[Configuring HDLC Functions](../../../../software/nev8r10_vrpv8r16/user/vrp/dc_vrp_hdlc_ip-trunk_cfg_0003.html)

This section describes how to configure HDLC encapsulation and optional HDLC parameters.

[Configuring an IP-Trunk Interface](../../../../software/nev8r10_vrpv8r16/user/vrp/dc_vrp_hdlc_ip-trunk_cfg_0008.html)

IP-Trunk interfaces are a type of trunk interface. You can configure an IP-Trunk interface to implement link backup and traffic load balancing.

This section describes how to maintain HDLC and IP-Trunk, including deleting statistics about HDLC or IP-Trunk interfaces.
