Configuring WDM Interfaces
==========================

The physical layer of a WDM interface is configured in the WDM interface view, and service parameters are configured in the GE interface view.

#### Applicable Environment

WDM interfaces must be configured when the OTN is used to transmit Ethernet packets.


#### Pre-configuration Tasks

Before configuring WDM interfaces, complete the following tasks:

* Powering on the Router and confirming that the self-check is successful


[Configuring Optical Parameters](../../../../software/nev8r10_vrpv8r16/user/ne/dc_ne_wdm_cfg_2005.html)

Optical parameters are configured in the WDM interface view to allow the WDM interfaces at both ends of an optical fiber to communicate at the physical layer.

[Configuring Service Parameters](../../../../software/nev8r10_vrpv8r16/user/ne/dc_ne_wdm_cfg_2006.html)

Configuring service parameters in the Ethernet interface view allows the interface to bear services.

[Configuring OTN Delay Measurement](../../../../software/nev8r10_vrpv8r16/user/ne/dc_ne_wdm_cfg_2008.html)

Configuring OTN delay measurement allows you to obtain the two-way delay on an OTN.

[Verifying the WDM Interface Configuration](../../../../software/nev8r10_vrpv8r16/user/ne/dc_ne_wdm_cfg_2007.html)

After configurations of WDM interfaces are complete, verify the configuration.
