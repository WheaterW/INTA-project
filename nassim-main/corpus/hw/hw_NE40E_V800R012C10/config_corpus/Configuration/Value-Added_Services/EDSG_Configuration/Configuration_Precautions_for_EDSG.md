Configuration Precautions for EDSG

#### Feature Requirements

**Table 1** Feature requirements
| Feature Requirements | Series | Models |
| --- | --- | --- |
| After EDSG services are activated, SQ-to-CAR rate limiting is not supported. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| The device does not support SQ scheduling for EDSG services. Do not deploy SQ-based EDSG services on the device. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H |
| 1, EDSG services support both captive portal and quota exhaustion-triggered redirection. If both captive portal and quota exhaustion-triggered redirection are configured, captive portal preferentially takes effect.  2, In captive portal for EDSG services, the services are redirected based on the number of redirections configured regardless of success.  3, If captive portal is configured for both users and EDSG services, captive portal for users take effect before captive portal for EDSG services.  4, Captive portal for EDSG services does not support RUI backup. After a backup device switches to the master state, the services are redirected again. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| 1, EDSG services support the following actions: permit, deny, service-class, car, remark (re-mark packet priorities), or service-class edsg keep-queue-level.  2, The service-class action is specified for EDSG services.  The priority of service-class in a traffic behavior is higher than that for services, and service flows enter the service-class queue specified by the traffic behavior. As a result, the actual rate limit and statistics for services may not be as expected.  3, The remark dscp action is specified for EDSG services.  In the upstream direction, the priority of remark in a traffic behavior is higher than the priority of service-class for services, and service flows enter the service-class queue specified by the remark action. As a result, the actual rate limit and statistics for services may not be as expected.  In the downstream direction, service behaviors are not affected by the remark action. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| EDSG/DAA/BOD services do not support L2TP LAC users or Layer 2 leased line users. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| In VLL/VPLS access scenarios, downstream HQoS queues for EDSG/DAA services do not take effect, and CAR rate limit takes effect. If SQ is implemented, traffic volume quotas of users will be taken up. Therefore, you are advised not to use SQ rate limiting.  In the HQoS queue is configured for users and the EDSG service during VLL\VPLS access, the user HQoS queue takes effect, and CAR rate limiting takes effect for the EDSG service. When CAR rate limiting is configured for users and HQoS queue is configured for EDSG, CAR rate limiting takes effect for both users and the EDSG service. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| When EDSG services are generated for web users, the following restrictions apply:  1, If EDSG services exist in the web pre-authentication domain, users cannot be switched to the web authentication domain.  2, If users in the web pre-authentication domain switch the pre-authentication and authentication domains through login/logout, EDSG services cannot be generated for the users. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| 1. DAA and EDSG cannot be used together for the same user. When a user goes online and both DAA and EDSG are activated, DAA takes effect.  2. After DAA services are deactivated, EDSG services cannot be activated again.  3. After EDSG services are deactivated, DAA services cannot be activated again. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| RADIUS authentication cannot be implemented for EDSG services configured in a domain. Otherwise, EDSG service authentication is adversely affected.  If EDSG service authentication is required, EDSG services need to be activated according to the mode delivered by RADIUS. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
