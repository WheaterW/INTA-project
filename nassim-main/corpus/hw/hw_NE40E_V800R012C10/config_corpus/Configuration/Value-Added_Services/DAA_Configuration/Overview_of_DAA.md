Overview of DAA

#### Definition

Destination address accounting (DAA) implements differentiated accounting, rate limit, and priority scheduling based on traffic destination addresses.


#### Purpose

DAA is performed at different tariff levels that are defined based on different destination addresses of user access traffic. The functions implemented in carriers' broadband operation are as follows:

* Service types are distinguished based on destination addresses to implement statistics for traffic of different service types.
* Each type of service can correspond to one tariff level, implementing service-based refined operation functions and meeting requirements for settlement between local network carriers and Internet toll network carriers and for value-added services.
* Different bandwidth control is performed for different destination addresses. Flexible combinations of packages can be launched to meet service bandwidth requirements of different levels of users, which helps carriers segment markets and use limited network bandwidth resources to provide differentiated operations and services.
* Access users can log in to the portal and purchase, activate, or deactivate DAA policies as required, reducing carriers' O&M costs.
* An open architecture and standard interfaces are used to implement flexible interworking with systems, such as the AAA server, billing system, and policy server.

#### Benefits

DAA offers the following benefits to carriers:

* Carriers can use DAA to distinguish between Internet traffic and intranet traffic and perform accounting based on different tariff levels, ensuring operation revenues.
* Carriers can identify services based on the network segments of servers storing the services. When users access these servers to obtain services, carriers can perform differentiated rate limit, scheduling, and accounting on the services.
