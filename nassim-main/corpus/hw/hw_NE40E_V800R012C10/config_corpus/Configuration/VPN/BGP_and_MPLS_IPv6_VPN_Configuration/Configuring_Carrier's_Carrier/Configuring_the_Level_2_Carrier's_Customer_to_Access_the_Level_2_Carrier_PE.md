Configuring the Level 2 Carrier's Customer to Access the Level 2 Carrier PE
===========================================================================

The Level 2 carrier provides IPv6 VPN services for its users, and the configuration of the Level 2 carrier is similar to the configuration of CE accessing PE in the basic BGP/MPLS IPv6 VPN.

#### Procedure

* Refer to the configuration of the connection between the PE and CE in [Configuring a Basic BGP/MPLS IPv6 VPN](dc_vrp_mpls-l3vpn-v6_cfg_2057.html).
