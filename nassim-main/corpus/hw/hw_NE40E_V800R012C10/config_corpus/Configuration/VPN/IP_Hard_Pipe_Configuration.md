IP Hard Pipe Configuration
==========================

IP hard pipe is a pipe technology that establishes a static PW over a static bidirectional co-routed LSP to simulate an SDH private line.

#### Context

The M2K model does not support IP hard pipe configuration.

IP hard pipe is a pipe technology that establishes a static PW over a static bidirectional co-routed LSP to simulate an SDH leased line. The NE40E strictly isolates soft and hard pipes by reserving hardware so that the soft and hard pipes do not affect each other when carrying leased line services of high-value customers, reserving bandwidth and ensuring low delay for hard pipe services.
