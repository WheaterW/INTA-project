Configuring an ESI
==================

An ESI must be configured on a PE interface connecting to a CE. The PE interfaces connecting to the same CE must have the same ESI configured.

#### Context

After PEs exchange routes that carry ESIs, a PE learns about other PEs connecting to the same CE as itself, helping implement load balancing or FRR.

Before configuring an ESI on an interface, ensure that:

* The interface with an ESI configured has been bound to an EVPN instance using the [**evpn binding vpn-instance**](cmdqueryname=evpn+binding+vpn-instance) command.
* The interface with an ESI configured is in the up state. Otherwise, Ethernet segment routes cannot be generated.

An ESI can be obtained for an interface in the following ways:

* Static ESI configuration
* Dynamic ESI generation

Static ESI configuration is recommended. Compared with dynamic ESI generation, static configuration allows EVPN to implement faster traffic switching during a DF election in a dual-homing scenario with active-active PEs.

The features required in an EVPN dual-homing scenario, such as fast convergence, split horizon, and DF election, all become invalid in a single-homing scenario. In such a scenario, configuring an ESI is optional on the single-homing PE.

The format of a dynamically generated ESI is xxxx.xxxx.xxxx.xxxx.xxxx, where x is a hexadecimal number starting with 01 and consisting of the LACP system MAC address and LACP port key value. The remaining bits are padded with 0s.



#### Procedure

* Statically configure an ESI for an interface. 
  1. Run [**system-view**](cmdqueryname=system-view)
     
     
     
     The system view is displayed.
  2. Run [**interface**](cmdqueryname=interface) *interface-type* *interface-number*
     
     
     
     The interface view is displayed.
  3. Run [**esi**](cmdqueryname=esi) *esi*
     
     
     
     An ESI is configured.
  4. Run [**commit**](cmdqueryname=commit)
     
     
     
     The configuration is committed.
* Configure an interface to dynamically generate an ESI.
  1. Run [**system-view**](cmdqueryname=system-view)
     
     
     
     The system view is displayed.
  2. Run [**interface eth-trunk**](cmdqueryname=interface+eth-trunk) *trunk-id*
     
     
     
     The Eth-Trunk interface view is displayed.
  3. Run [**mode**](cmdqueryname=mode) **lacp-static**
     
     
     
     The working mode of the Eth-Trunk interface is set to static LACP.
     
     
     
     After this command is run in the Eth-Trunk interface view, a dynamic ESI is automatically generated.
  4. (Optional) Run [**ignore dynamic-esi**](cmdqueryname=ignore+dynamic-esi)
     
     
     
     The device is configured to ignore dynamically generated ESIs.
     
     
     
     After the [**mode**](cmdqueryname=mode) **lacp-static** command is run on an interface, an ESI is dynamically generated by default. In a single-homing scenario, ESIs are not required. To enable an interface to ignore dynamically generated ESIs, run this command. In an EVPN VPLS scenario, no ESIs are generated for Ethernet A-D and Ethernet segment routes, and MAC routes carry all-0 ESIs.
  5. Run [**commit**](cmdqueryname=commit)
     
     
     
     The configuration is committed.
