Configuring Route Exchange Between a CE and an ASBR
===================================================

The configuration of route exchange between a CE and an ASBR is similar to the configuration of route exchange between a CE and a PE on a basic BGP/MPLS IP VPN.

#### Procedure

1. Configure a routing protocol between a CE and an ASBR based on the actual situation. For configuration details, see [Configuring Route Exchange Between PEs and CEs](dc_vrp_mpls-l3vpn-v4_cfg_0158.html).
