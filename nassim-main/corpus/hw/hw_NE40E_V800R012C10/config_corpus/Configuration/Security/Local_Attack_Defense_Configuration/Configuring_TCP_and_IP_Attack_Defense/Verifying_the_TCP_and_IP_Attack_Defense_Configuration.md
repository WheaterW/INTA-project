Verifying the TCP/IP Attack Defense Configuration
=================================================

After defense against TCP/IP attacks is configured, you can view the statistics about it, including the total number of illegal TCP/IP packets, the number of legal TCP/IP packets, and the number of discarded packets.

#### Procedure

1. Run the [**display cpu-defend**](cmdqueryname=display+cpu-defend+tcpip-defend+statistics) **tcpip-defend** **statistics** [ **slot** *slot-id* ] command to view information about defense against TCP/IP attacks.
2. Run the [**display cpu-defend**](cmdqueryname=display+cpu-defend+tcpip-defend-v6+statistics) **tcpip-defend-v6** **statistics** [ **slot** *slot-id* ] command to view information about defense against TCP/IPv6 attacks.
