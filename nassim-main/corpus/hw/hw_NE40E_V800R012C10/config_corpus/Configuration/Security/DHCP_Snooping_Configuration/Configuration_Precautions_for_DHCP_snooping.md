Configuration Precautions for DHCP snooping

#### Feature Requirements

**Table 1** Feature requirements
| Feature Requirements | Series | Models |
| --- | --- | --- |
| When a BD is bound to a VSI, DHCP snooping in the BD does not support client access from the network side (PW side). Otherwise, PW-side access users fail to go online.  You are advised to plan the network properly. Do not deploy DHCP snooping when clients access the network from the PW side. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| In a scenario where a BD is bound to a VSI, a VBDIF interface is configured, and the DHCP relay function is enabled on the VBDIF interface, if a client accesses the network from the PW side, DHCP snooping cannot be configured. As a result, the client fails to go online.  You are advised to plan the network properly. Do not deploy DHCP snooping when a client accesses the network from the PW side. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| The ARP probe aging function of DHCP snooping entries applies only to Layer 3 networking. The binding entries generated in Layer 2 networking do not support ARP probe aging. Otherwise, in Layer 2 scenarios, DHCP snooping entries go offline only after the lease expires. ARP probe aging is not supported. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| DHCP snooping cannot filter DHCP packets to be sent to the CPU based on the whitelist in multi-VS scenarios.  You are advised to configure the whitelist function only in the admin VS. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| After DHCP snooping strict MAC check is enabled, an IP address can be bound only to a unique MAC address in a broadcast domain. When users with different MAC addresses apply for the same IP address, the user who attempts to go online later is considered as an unauthorized user and is not allowed to go online. In a scenario where the STB functions as the DHCP client for access, after the client obtains an IP address from the server, the MAC address of the client may change when the user changes the STB. If DHCP snooping strict MAC check is enabled, new clients (new MAC addresses) cannot go online before the original MAC address of the client ages.  You are advised to plan the network properly. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| In VPLS scenarios, DHCP snooping does not support user access from the network (PW) side. As a result, users connected to the PW side fail to go online.  Properly plan the network. Do not deploy DHCP snooping when a client accesses the network through a PW. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| Among global VE sub-interfaces and VE sub-interfaces, only sub-interfaces with the l3-access attribute support DHCP snooping, which is used together with DHCP relay. Enable both DHCP relay and DHCP snooping on sub-interfaces configured with the l3-access attribute.  You are advised to properly plan the networking to prevent service interruption and traffic interruption. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| On a Layer 3 network, DHCP snooping can be deployed only together with DHCP relay. DHCP snooping must be enabled on the interface enabled with DHCP relay.  You are advised to plan the network properly to prevent service interruption and traffic interruption. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| After strict MAC check is enabled, only one IP address can be bound to a unique MAC address in a broadcast domain. If different MAC addresses have applied for the same IP address in sequence, the latter ones are considered invalid, and corresponding users are not allowed to go online. When the STB functions as an access DHCP client, after the DHCP client applies to the DHCP server for an IP address, the MAC address of the STB may change during an STB replacement. If strict MAC check is enabled for DHCP snooping in this case, the new client (new MAC) cannot go online before the old MAC ages.  You are advised to plan the network properly. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| DHCP snooping VPLS applies only to the following scenarios:  1. Both the DHCP client and DHCP server access the network through the local AC. Enable DHCP snooping on the AC sub-interface connected to the DHCP client, enable DHCP snooping on the AC sub-interface connected to the DHCP server, and configure the AC sub-interface as a trusted interface.  2. The DHCP client accesses the network through the local AC, and the DHCP server is deployed on the remote end through the VPLS tunnel. Enable DHCP snooping on the AC sub-interface connected to the DHCP client, enable DHCP snooping on the public network interface of the VPLS tunnel, and configure the interface as a trusted interface. Alternatively, enable DHCP snooping on the AC sub-interface connected to the DHCP client, and enable the network-side interface to send DHCP reply packets in the VSI where the AC sub-interface resides.  You are advised to properly plan the networking to prevent service interruption and traffic interruption. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| In a scenario where a BD is bound to a VSI, a VBDIF interface is configured, and the DHCP relay function is enabled on the VBDIF interface. In this case, if a client accesses the network side (PW side), DHCP snooping cannot be configured together with the VBDIF interface. As a result, the user who accesses the network side (PW side) fails to go online.  Properly plan the network. Do not deploy DHCP snooping when a client accesses the network through a PW. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| When a BD is bound to a VSI, DHCP snooping in the BD does not support user access from the network side (PW side). As a result, users fail to go online from the PW side.  Properly plan the network. Do not deploy DHCP snooping when a client accesses the network through a PW. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| On a Layer 2 network, DHCP snooping must be deployed between the DHCP client and DHCP relay agent, but not between the DHCP relay agent and DHCP server.  You are advised to plan the network properly to prevent service interruption and traffic interruption. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| DHCP snooping does not support the function of filtering DHCP packets based on the whitelist in multiple VSs.  The whitelist function is configured only in the Admin-VS. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| The ARP probe aging function of DHCP snooping entries applies only to Layer 3 networking. In Layer 2 networking, the binding entries generated do not support ARP probe aging. In Layer 2 scenarios, DHCP snooping entries go offline only after the lease expires, and ARP aging probe is not supported. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
