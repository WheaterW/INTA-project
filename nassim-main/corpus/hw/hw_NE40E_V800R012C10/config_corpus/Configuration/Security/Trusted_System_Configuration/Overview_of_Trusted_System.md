Overview of Trusted System

#### Definition

You can use the trusted system to view and manage the digital signature, trusted boot, secure boot, and remote attestation functions on a device to implement system trustworthiness.

A trusted system indicates that system hardware and software are running as designed. The prerequisite for a trusted system is that the system software integrity is high and free of intrusion or unauthorized modification.


#### Purpose

Global communications service providers, enterprises, and government networks depend on the running of communications networks. The integrity of data and IT infrastructure is the basis for maintaining these networks and users' trust. In addition, the threat environment is changing. Protecting networks from intrusion, forgery, and tampering becomes critical.

A communication device is composed of multiple embedded computer systems. The software of a device may be attacked by viruses, or may be tampered with or attacked by Trojan horses by means of vulnerabilities. Once untrusted devices access the network, the security of the entire network may be compromised. A network can be trustworthy only when it can be accessed only by trusted devices. With digital signature, trusted boot, secure boot, and remote attestation users can ensure that all devices accessing the network are trusted.


#### Benefits

A trusted system consists of digital signature, trusted boot, secure boot, and remote attestation and offers the following benefits:

* Use the device hardware capability and initial boot code to establish trustworthiness on the trusted boot platform.
* Trusted boot provides software integrity measurement, trusted status query, and trusted status warning.
* Secure boot allows only trusted devices to start.
* RA allows users to remotely check device trustworthiness.
