Packet Header Obtaining Configuration
=====================================

Packet header getting enables a device to obtain packet headers sent to central processing units (CPUs) or forwarded packet headers for fault locating.

Based on your requirements to detect failures in telecom transmission, this feature may collect or store some communication information about specific customers. Huawei cannot offer services to collect or store this information unilaterally. Before enabling the function, ensure that it is performed within the boundaries permitted by applicable laws and regulations. Effective measures must be taken to ensure that information is securely protected.
