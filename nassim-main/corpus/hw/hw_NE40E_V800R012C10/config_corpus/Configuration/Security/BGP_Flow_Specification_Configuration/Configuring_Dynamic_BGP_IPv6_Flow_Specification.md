Configuring Dynamic BGP IPv6 Flow Specification
===============================================

Dynamic BGP IPv6 Flow Specification uses a traffic analysis server to generate BGP IPv6 Flow Specification routes to control traffic.

#### Usage Scenario

Before deploying dynamic BGP IPv6 Flow Specification, you need to establish a BGP IPv6 Flow Specification peer relationship between the traffic analysis server and each ingress of the network to transmit BGP IPv6 Flow Specification routes.

In an AS with multiple ingresses, a BGP IPv6 Flow route reflector (Flow RR) can be deployed to reduce the number of BGP IPv6 Flow Specification peer relationships and save network resources.

If you want to filter traffic based on the address prefix but the BGP IPv6 Flow Specification route carrying the filtering rule cannot pass validation, disable the validation of BGP IPv6 Flow Specification routes received from a specified peer.


#### Pre-configuration Tasks

Before configuring the dynamic BGP IPv6 Flow Specification function, complete the following task:

* [Configure a BGP4+ peer](dc_vrp_bgp6_cfg_0005.html) or [configure a BGP peer](dc_vrp_bgp_cfg_3006.html).

#### Procedure

1. Establish a BGP IPv6 Flow Specification peer relationship.
   1. Run [**system-view**](cmdqueryname=system-view)
      
      
      
      The system view is displayed.
   2. Run [**bgp**](cmdqueryname=bgp) *as-number*
      
      
      
      The BGP view is displayed.
   3. Run [**ipv6-family flow**](cmdqueryname=ipv6-family+flow)
      
      
      
      The BGP-IPv6-Flow address family view is displayed.
   4. Run [**peer**](cmdqueryname=peer+enable) { *ipv4-address* | *ipv6-address* } **enable**
      
      
      
      A BGP IPv6 Flow Specification peer relationship is established.
      
      
      
      After the peer relationship is established in the BGP-IPv6-Flow address family view, the BGP IPv6 Flow Specification route generated by the traffic analysis server is imported automatically to the BGP routing table and then sent to the peer.
   5. Run [**commit**](cmdqueryname=commit)
      
      
      
      The configuration is committed.
2. (Optional) Configure a Flow RR.
   
   
   
   Before configuring a Flow RR, establish a BGP IPv6 Flow Specification peer relationship between the Flow RR and traffic analysis server and between the Flow RR and every network ingress.
   
   
   
   1. Run [**system-view**](cmdqueryname=system-view)
      
      
      
      The system view is displayed.
   2. Run [**bgp**](cmdqueryname=bgp) *as-number*
      
      
      
      The BGP view is displayed.
   3. Run [**ipv6-family flow**](cmdqueryname=ipv6-family+flow)
      
      
      
      The BGP-IPv6-Flow address family view is displayed.
   4. Run [**peer**](cmdqueryname=peer+reflect-client) { *ipv4-address* | *ipv6-address* } **reflect-client**
      
      
      
      An IPv6 Flow RR is configured, and clients are specified for it.
      
      
      
      The Router on which the [**peer reflect-client**](cmdqueryname=peer+reflect-client) command is run functions as a Flow RR, and the network ingress and traffic analysis server function as clients.
   5. (Optional) Run [**undo reflect between-clients**](cmdqueryname=undo+reflect+between-clients)
      
      
      
      Route reflection between clients through the RR is disabled.
      
      
      
      If the clients of a Flow RR are fully meshed, you can run the [**undo reflect between-clients**](cmdqueryname=undo+reflect+between-clients) command on the Flow RR to disable route reflection between clients through the RR, which reduces costs.
   6. (Optional) Run [**reflector cluster-id**](cmdqueryname=reflector+cluster-id) { *cluster-id-value* | *cluster-id-ipv4* }
      
      
      
      A cluster ID is configured for the Flow RR.
      
      
      
      If a cluster has multiple flow RRs, run this command to set the same *cluster-id* for these RRs.
      
      ![](../../../../public_sys-resources/note_3.0-en-us.png) 
      
      The [**reflector cluster-id**](cmdqueryname=reflector+cluster-id) command applies only to RRs.
   7. Run [**commit**](cmdqueryname=commit)

      The BGP view is displayed.
   3. Run [**ipv6-family flow**](cmdqueryname=ipv6-family+flow)

      The validation of BGP IPv6 Flow Specification routes received from a specified peer is disabled.

   2. Run [**flowspec statistic enable**](cmdqueryname=flowspec+statistic+enable)

   2. Run [**interface**](cmdqueryname=interface) *interface-type* *interface-number*
      
      
      
      The interface view is displayed.
   3. Run [**flowspec disable**](cmdqueryname=flowspec+disable+ipv4+ipv6) [ **ipv4** | **ipv6** ]

      ![](../../../../public_sys-resources/note_3.0-en-us.png) 
      
      This command cannot be configured on Eth-Trunk member interfaces. The configuration on a main interface also takes effect on its sub-interfaces.
      
      If BGP Flow Specification does not need to be disabled on a sub-interface, run the [**flowspec disable**](cmdqueryname=flowspec+disable+ipv4+ipv6+sub-port-exclude) [ **ipv4** | **ipv6** ] **sub-port-exclude** command on the main interface to which the sub-interface belongs.
