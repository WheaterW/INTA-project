#### Feature Requirements

**Table 1** Feature requirements
| Feature Requirements | Series | Models |
| --- | --- | --- |
| In L2VPN over SRv6 outbound tunnel scenarios, BGP FlowSpec cannot match inner packets. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| In SRv6 USD End.X outbound tunnel scenarios, BGP FlowSpec cannot match inner packets. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| After the IPv4 destination community attribute-based BGP FlowSpec traffic filtering rule is enabled, traffic that does not match other BGP FlowSpec traffic filtering rules is matched against the IPv4 destination community attribute-based traffic filtering rule again.  If both the IPv4 destination community attribute-based BGP FlowSpec traffic filtering rule and BGP FlowSpec cascading mode are enabled, BGP FlowSpec is implemented in the following sequence:  Interface group-specific traffic filtering rule that is not based on the IPv4 destination community attribute -> Interface group-specific traffic filtering rule that is based on the IPv4 destination community attribute -> Global traffic filtering rule that is not based on the IPv4 destination community attribute -> Global traffic filtering rule that is based on the IPv4 destination community attribute | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| The value range of rate in the apply traffic-rate rate command is 1-100000000 KBps, but the value range that takes effect is 0-12500000 KBps. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H |
| BAS interfaces do not support BGP Flow Specification. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H |
| BGP IPv6 Flow Specification configuration conflict rules are as follows:  1. Both a port type and a source or destination port type are configured in the same BGP FlowSpec IPv6 route.  2. A BGP FlowSpec route is configured with a port type, source port type, or destination port type and also an ICMP type or ICMP code type.  3. A BGP FlowSpec IPv6 route is configured with a non-TCP or non-UDP protocol type and also a port type, source port type, or destination port type.  4. A BGP FlowSpec IPv6 route is configured with a non-ICMP protocol type and also an ICMPTYPE or ICMPCODE type.  5. The type of the rule configured in a BGP FlowSpec IPv6 route is not supported.  6. The rule parameters configured in a BGP FlowSpec IPv6 route are out of the valid range.  7. The valid range of the same type of rules configured for a BGP FlowSpec IPv6 route is empty.  After a conflict rule is configured, the rule is not delivered. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H |
| BGP Flow Specification does not support last fragment check. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H |
| When the TCP flag is set to NOT 0, BGP Flow Specification considers that the matching conditions are not met and does not deliver rules. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H |
| BGP FlowSpec configuration conflict rules are as follows:  1. If a BGP FlowSpec route is configured with both a port type and a source or destination port type, a conflict occurs.  2. If a BGP FlowSpec route is configured with both a port type/source port type/destination port type and a TCPFLAG type but not configured with any protocol type, a conflict occurs.  3. If a BGP FlowSpec route is configured with both a port type/source port type/destination port type/TCPFLAG type and an ICPMTYPE or ICMPCODE type, a conflict occurs.  4. If a BGP FlowSpec route is configured with a protocol type other than TCP or UDP and a port type/source port type/destination port type, a conflict occurs.  5. If a BGP FlowSpec route is configured with a non-TCP protocol type and a TCPFLAG type, a conflict occurs.  6. If a BGP FlowSpec route is configured with a non-ICMP protocol type and an ICMPTYPE or ICMPCODE type, a conflict occurs.  7. Currently, the rule type configured in the BGP FlowSpec route is not supported.  8. The rule parameter configured in the BGP FlowSpec route is out of range.  9. The valid range of the rules of the same type configured in the BGP FlowSpec route is empty.  After conflict rules are configured, the rules are not delivered. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H |
| If both a redirection next-hop IP address and a redirection VPN target are configured for BGP Flow Specification, the redirection VPN target takes effect. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H |
| BGP Flow Specification does not support the copy mode for the redirect-to-next-hop action. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H |
| BGP Flow Specification does not support RFC 5575 sampling or next-rule behavior. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H |
| If FlowSpec, MF classification, and QPPB are configured together and the actions are all forwarding  or non-forwarding actions, the actions override each other based on the following priorities. For non-forwarding actions: QPPB > MF classification > FlowSpec. For the action of redirecting traffic to a VPN: MF classification > QPPB > FlowSpec. For the action of redirecting traffic to a next hop: FlowSpec > MF classification > QPPB. Non-forwarding actions for FlowSpec include rate limiting and remark dscp.  Forwarding actions include redirecting packets to a VPN and redirecting packets to a next hop.  When forwarding and non-forwarding actions are configured together, both of them take effect.  Two-level CAR is supported. CAR is performed for traffic, and level-3 CAR does not take effect.  CAR configurations take effect in the search sequence: QPPB > MF classification > FlowSpec.  Port CAR is not affected by the preceding restrictions and can take effect at the same time. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H |
| Only unicast packets can be protected. By default, reserved multicast protocol packets are not processed based on flowspec ACLs. However, when reserved multicast ACLs are enabled, reserved multicast protocol packets are also processed based on flowspec ACLs. In this case, the protocol disconnection prevention function does not take effect. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H |
| If the TCP flag is set to any-match 0 in BGP Flow Specification, BGP Flow Specification considers that no matching rule is met and does not deliver rules. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H |
| In the interface view, the flowspec refluence command and the traffic-policy command are mutually exclusive. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H |
| The protocol defense function is enabled by default. FlowSpec is not performed on all packets destined for the local device. The CPU security policy on the local device is used to defend against the attack packets destined for the local device. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H |
| BGP Flow Specification protection does not take effect for reserved multicast protocol packets of BGP, LDP, and OSPF. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H |
| BGP IPv6 Flow Specification can match fragment packets, but cannot identify whether a packet is the first fragment or a subsequent fragment.  1. In the static configuration scenario, the rule for matching the first fragment and subsequent fragments cannot be configured.  2. In the dynamic advertisement scenario, if the rule is for matching the first fragment or subsequent fragments, the rule does not take effect. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| When the flowspec ipv4-fragment-rule switch command is configured or deleted, the IPv4 fragment filtering rules for BGP Flow Specification routes become invalid temporarily. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H |
