AAA and User Management Overview
================================

AAA provides security functions for user authentication,
authorization, and accounting.

#### AAA

Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) refers to a combination of security-related technologies used to authenticate and authorize users, as well as to account for the service provided to the users.

* Authentication: checks whether a user has the rights to access the network.
* Authorization: authorizes a user so that the user can use a specified service.
* Accounting: records the usage of network resources for charging purposes.

AAA uses the client/server model. This model features good extensibility and facilitates centralized management over user information, as shown in [Figure 1](#EN-US_CONCEPT_0172371751__en-us_concept_0172357084_fig_dc_vrp_aaa_feature_000399818201).**Figure 1** AAA networking
