Overview of HIPS

#### Definition

The Host-based Intrusion Prevention System (HIPS) monitors a device's system for intrusions and infections. Unlike the Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) â which analyzes and processes the traffic passing through a device to protect devices and users on the internal network â HIPS protects the device's system.


#### Purpose

The security of network devices, which are important components of ICT infrastructure, directly affects the security of the entire network. Network devices are prone to hacker attacks and intrusions because they are usually deployed in front of servers and terminals. After intruding into a network device, a hacker can further penetrate the network through the device. To prevent this, HIPS is introduced to monitor the device's operating system, as shown in [Figure 1](#EN-US_CONCEPT_0000001204798583__en-us_concept_0000001158902216_fig367619361214). Once a suspected intrusion or infection event is detected, HIPS immediately sends a log to prompt the administrator to isolate and protect the device, preventing further intrusions and compromising the security of other devices.
