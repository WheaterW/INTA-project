Configuration Precautions for BIER

#### Feature Requirements

**Table 1** Feature requirements
| Feature Requirements | Series | Models |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Maximum number of processes that can be imported to a single SD across BIERv6 processes.  Considering the actual application scenario on the live network, the number of unicast import processes does not exceed 3 to 4. However, the number of unicast OM processes is not limited. BIER depends on unicast. Therefore, the hard limit of OM cannot be added. BIER promises that a single SD is bound to the master process and supports a maximum of 10 slave processes.  Eight BIER sub-domains on a device support a maximum of 10 processes. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| The combination of opcode referenced by SEGRv6 and locator is an SID. When sid and opcode configured for end-bier belong to the same locator network segment:  1. Two non-overlapping segments in the network segment must be allocated to them.  2. The SID that is being used or has been used by the peer component cannot be referenced by the current component. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| MVPN over BIER supports only physical main interfaces and sub-interfaces, Eth-Trunk main interfaces and sub-interfaces, dot1q VLAN tag termination sub-interfaces, QinQ VLAN tag termination sub-interfaces, and POS interfaces. If the BIER selects an unsupported interface as the next-hop outbound interface, forwarding fails. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| MVPN over BIER does not support MTU-based packet fragmentation. If the size of a packet exceeds the MTU configured on an interface, the interface forwards the packet without fragmenting it. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| The tunnel types configured for the root nodes in an MVPN over BIER dual-root protection scenario cannot be different. Otherwise, fast switching of dual-root protection does not take effect. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| In a BIER load balancing scenario where an Eth-Trunk interface is one of the outbound interfaces, traffic may not be evenly balanced among the member interfaces of the Eth-Trunk interface.  You are recommended to ensure that the number of outbound interfaces for BIER load balancing and the number of Eth-Trunk member interfaces are not a multiple of each other. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H |
| In BIER multi-level load balancing scenarios, traffic may not be evenly load balanced at each level. For example, when the number of load balancing paths configured for two adjacent hops is a multiple relationship, the second hop may fail to perform load balancing (which is not limited to this case).  You can adjust the number of load balancing paths at each level to optimize the load balancing effect. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| MVPN over BIER supports dual-root 1+1 protection in traffic monitoring mode. MVPN over BIER does not support BFD-based dual-root 1+1 protection. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| 1) A maximum of eight sub-domains can be configured on a device.  2) A maximum of four sub-domains can be configured for the same BFR prefix, topology, and underlay protocol. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| In an MVPN over BIER scenario, only BIER tunnels can be deployed for I-PMSI and S-PMSI tunnels, and the I-PMSI and S-PMSI tunnels must use the same sub-domain and BSL. Otherwise, the configuration fails. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| Among multiple devices in the same sub-domain, only the devices with the same BSL can forward data to each other. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| The BIER does not support LFA routes. In a fault scenario, the larger the ring is, the slower the convergence is.  Properly plan the network to prevent microloops. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| Different devices need to have different BFR prefix addresses and BFR-IDs deployed.  BFR prefixes can be advertised only as host routes, not network segment routes. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
