Establishing an LDP LSP
=======================

An LDP LSP can be automatically established only after an LDP session is established.

#### Context

If [local LDP sessions](dc_vrp_ldp-p2p_cfg_0003.html) have been established among the neighboring LSRs on an LSP to be established, an LDP LSP can be established automatically.
