L2TP Access Configuration
=========================

An L2TP tunnel can be established to provide access services for enterprises, small ISPs, and mobile workforce over a public network.

#### Prerequisites

In VS mode, this feature is supported only by the admin VS.



[Overview of L2TP Access](../../../../software/nev8r10_vrpv8r16/user/ne/dc_ne_l2tp_cfg_014425.html)

Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol (L2TP) is a VPN tunneling protocol that allows remote users (such as enterprise branches and traveling staff) to securely communicate with private network servers over public networks (such as the Internet).

[Configuring a LAC](../../../../software/nev8r10_vrpv8r16/user/ne/dc_ne_l2tp_cfg_013689.html)

To establish an L2TP tunnel between a LAC and an LNS, configuring the LAC, including starting an L2TP connection and setting tunnel parameters and an authentication mode for the LAC.

[Configuring an LNS](../../../../software/nev8r10_vrpv8r16/user/ne/dc_ne_l2tp_cfg_013697.html)

To establish an L2TP tunnel between a LAC and an LNS, you need to configure an L2TP connection and set tunnel parameters and an authentication mode on the LNS.

[Configuring L2TP Tunnel Switching](../../../../software/nev8r10_vrpv8r16/user/ne/dc_ne_l2tp_cfg_013484.html)

Networking modes are diverse. If a user accesses an LNS across several tunnels, configure L2TP tunnel switching on the intermediate devices.

[(Optional) Configuring L2TP HQoS](../../../../software/nev8r10_vrpv8r16/user/ne/dc_ne_l2tp_cfg_013489.html)

L2TP HQoS helps refined control over the L2TP service traffic.

[(Optional) Adjusting L2TP Connection Parameters](../../../../software/nev8r10_vrpv8r16/user/ne/dc_ne_l2tp_cfg_013495.html)

By adjusting L2TP connection parameters, you can flexibly control L2TP tunnel establishment and the interconnection between Huawei devices and non-Huawei devices.

[Maintaining L2TP](../../../../software/nev8r10_vrpv8r16/user/ne/dc_ne_l2tp_cfg_013515.html)

You can maintain L2TP by disconnecting L2TP tunnels.

[Configuration Examples for L2TP Access](../../../../software/nev8r10_vrpv8r16/user/ne/dc_ne_l2tp_cfg_013506.html)

This section provides several L2TP configuration examples.
