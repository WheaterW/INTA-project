=====================================

This section describes how to assign and manage IPv4 addresses for access users through IPv4 address management.

#### Context

In VS mode, this feature is supported only by the admin VS.



[Overview of IPv4 Address Management](../../../../software/nev8r10_vrpv8r16/user/ne/dc_ne_ipv4_address_cfg_0151.html)

IPv4 address management includes IP address obtaining in different ways.

[Configuring an IPv4 Address Pool and an Address Pool Group](../../../../software/nev8r10_vrpv8r16/user/ne/dc_ne_ipv4_address_cfg_0048.html)

After an IPv4 address pool is configured, users can obtain IPv4 addresses from the IPv4 address pool.

[Configuring a DHCPv4 Server Group](../../../../software/nev8r10_vrpv8r16/user/ne/dc_ne_ipv4_address_cfg_0033.html)

A DHCPv4 server group is required only when a remote address pool is used to assign IP addresses to users that use a BAS interface for access.

[Adjusting DHCPv4 Service Parameters](../../../../software/nev8r10_vrpv8r16/user/ne/dc_ne_ipv4_address_cfg_0041.html)

You can adjust DHCPv4 service parameters to enhance the security of the DHCPv4 service.

[Maintaining DHCPv4](../../../../software/nev8r10_vrpv8r16/user/ne/dc_ne_ipv4_address_cfg_0062.html)

You can maintain DHCPv4 by clearing DHCPv4 statistics and monitoring DHCPv4 operating status.

[IPv4 Address Management Configuration Examples](../../../../software/nev8r10_vrpv8r16/user/ne/dc_ne_ipv4_address_cfg_0065.html)

This section provides several examples of IPv4 address management. Each configuration example includes networking requirements, configuration precautions, and configuration roadmap, among others.
