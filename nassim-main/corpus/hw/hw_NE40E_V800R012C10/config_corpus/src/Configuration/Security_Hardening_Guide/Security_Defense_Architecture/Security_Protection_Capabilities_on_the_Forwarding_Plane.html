<div><p></p>
<p>To ensure the device's CPU runs normally, the forwarding plane on <span class="keyword">NE40E</span> provides the following security defense capabilities:</p>
<ul><li>ACLs</li><li>Unicast reverse path forwarding (URPF)</li><li>DHCP snooping</li><li>CAR for packets sent to the CPU (CPCAR)</li><li>ACL-based user-defined flow</li></ul>
<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">ACLs</h4><p>An access control list (ACL) is a collection of ordered rules, each containing the source and destination addresses and port number of packets. It classifies packets based on these rules. When applied to a router, these rules enable the router to determine whether to permit or deny packets.</p>
<p>For example, an ACL can be used to deny all Telnet access terminals from accessing the local device or allow terminals to send emails to the local device over Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP).</p>
<p>Multiple rules can be defined for one ACL. The rules are classified as interface<span>, MPLS</span>, basic, or advanced ACL rules based on their functions. An ACL rule is a set of matching options, and users can select and configure it based on services.</p>
<p>ACLs can be classified from different perspectives. See the following table.</p>

<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">URPF</h4><p>A URPF-capable router queries forwarding information bases (FIBs) when Layer 3 IP packets arrive at the NP. If these packets take a local route, the router performs the URPF check before sending them to the control processor (CP). During the URPF check, the router checks whether the source IP addresses of packets are valid based on the routing table.</p>
<p>URPF can be set to work in either strict mode or loose mode:</p>
<ul><li>In strict mode, if a packet matches a specific route and the inbound interface of the packet is the same as the outbound interface of the route, the packet is allowed to pass. Otherwise, the packet is discarded.</li><li>In loose mode, if a packet matches a specific route, the packet is allowed to pass. Otherwise, the packet is discarded. By default, matching of default routes is not performed unless configured.</li></ul>
<p>Matching of default routes must work with strict URPF. When a packet matches a either specific route or default route and the packet's inbound interface is the same as the outbound interface of the matched route, the packet is allowed to pass. Otherwise, the packet is discarded. Loose URPF and strict URPF are mutually exclusive.</p>

<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Security Defense Based on Access Control</h4><div class="p">The <span class="keyword">NE40E</span> provide complete ACL capabilities. ACLs can be used to implement CPCAR<span> and user-defined flows</span> can be implemented.<ul><li><p>CPCAR classifies packets destined for the CPU and applies rules for limiting the rate of each type of packet. It allows you to set the average rate, committed burst size (CBS), and priority of packets. Setting particular CAR rules for each type of packet helps reduce mutual impact between different types of packets, protecting the CPU. CAR can also be used to set the total rate of packets sent to the CPU. When the total rate exceeds the upper limit, the system discards the excess packets to prevent CPU overload.</p>
</li><li><p>A user-defined flow is bound to ACL rules defined by a user to filter packets. It comes into effect when unknown attacks are detected on a network. You can flexibly specify data characteristics of attack flows so that flows with these characteristics are not sent.</p>
<p>To prevent the <span class="keyword">NE40E</span> from being controlled by unauthorized users or attacked by flooding management packets, a CPU defense policy can be deployed. With the CPU defense policy, only specified interfaces are allowed to receive management packets, while packets received by other interfaces will be directly discarded to conserve resources. You can also configure the interface to receive management packets of specified protocols, and packets of other protocols are directly discarded to prevent attacks.</p>
