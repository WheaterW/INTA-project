<h1 class="topicTitle-h1">Summary of BFD Configuration Tasks</h1>
<div><p><span>BFD</span> is a unified detection mechanism that is used across a network and can work with multiple protocols. This section describes BFD features supported by the <span class="keyword">NE40E</span>.</p>
<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">BFD Session Establishment Modes</h4><div class="p">BFD uses local and remote discriminators to differentiate multiple BFD sessions between a pair of systems. Based on the differences in methods of creating the local and remote discriminators, the <span class="keyword">NE40E</span> supports the following types of BFD sessions:<ul><li>Static BFD sessions with manually specified discriminators<p>Local and remote discriminators must be set manually.</p>
</li><li>Static BFD sessions with automatically negotiated discriminators<p>BFD monitors a static route and helps a node communicate with a remote node on which a dynamic BFD session is established. No local or remote discriminator needs to be set.</p>
</li><li>BFD sessions dynamically triggered by protocols<div class="p">No local or remote discriminator needs to be set. BFD sessions are further classified into the following types:<ul><li>BFD sessions with dynamically allocated local discriminators</li><li>BFD sessions with self-learned remote discriminators</li></ul>
</div>
</li></ul>
</div>
<div class="p">If the two ends of a BFD session create discriminators in different modes, the following conditions must be satisfied:<ul><li>In a static BFD session, if discriminators on the local end are manually specified, then discriminators on the remote end must also be manually specified.</li><li>If static discriminators on the local end are automatically negotiated, discriminators on the remote end can be automatically negotiated or a dynamic BFD session can be established on the remote end.</li><li>On the local end, if a static BFD session with automatically negotiated discriminators and a dynamic BFD session are established, the following principles are applicable:<ul><li>If a dynamic BFD session and a static BFD session with automatically negotiated discriminators are configured with the same 5-tuple set (source and destination addresses, outbound interface, VPN index, and VS identifier), the <span class="keyword">NE40E</span> uses the shared BFD session to which both the dynamic BFD session and static BFD session with automatically negotiated discriminators belong.</li><li>If the dynamic BFD session named DYN_local discriminator is configured and then the static BFD session with automatically negotiated discriminators is configured, the name of the shared BFD session is updated to the name of the static BFD session.</li><li>The smaller values of parameters between two BFD sessions are adopted.</li></ul>
</li></ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Detection Modes</h4><p>The <span class="keyword">NE40E</span> supports asynchronous detection. Each system sends BFD control packets at negotiated intervals. If a system does not receive packets from the peer within a detection period, the BFD session goes down.</p>
<p>Echo is also supported in asynchronous mode. When the echo function is activated, the local system sends a BFD control packet and the remote system loops the packet back through the forwarding channel. If several consecutive echo packets are not received, the session is declared to be down.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Single- and Multi-hop BFD</h4><p>The <span class="keyword">NE40E</span> supports single- and multi-hop BFD. Single- and multi-hop BFD monitors IP route continuity.</p>
<div class="p">On the <span class="keyword">NE40E</span>, single-hop BFD can monitor the following types of interfaces and links:<ul><li><p>Layer 3 physical interfaces</p>
</li><li><p>Ethernet sub-interfaces including Eth-Trunk sub-interfaces</p>
<p>If a physical Ethernet interface has multiple sub-interfaces, BFD sessions can be established separately on the physical Ethernet interface and each of its sub-interfaces.</p>
</li><li><p>IP-Trunk</p>
</li><li><p>Layer 3 Eth-Trunk</p>
</li><li>ATM interfaces or ATM sub-interfaces</li></ul>
<div class="note"><img src="../../../../public_sys-resources/note_3.0-en-us.png"><span class="notetitle"> </span><div class="notebody"><p><span>Both IP-Trunks and </span>Eth-Trunks consist of multiple member links, which provide high bandwidth or enhance reliability.</p>
<p>A trunk remains up only when a certain number of member links are up.</p>
</div></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Dynamically Modifying BFD Parameters</h4><p>After a BFD session is set up, you can modify BFD parameters, such as the minimum intervals at which BFD packets are sent and received and detection mode. This modification does not affect the current session status.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Binding a BFD Session to a VPN Instance</h4><p>On the <span class="keyword">NE40E</span>, a BFD session can be bound to a VPN instance to allow BFD control packets to be sent over a specified VPN.</p>

As a result, if a fault occurs on the network, the administrator needs to handle it.

The routing management (RM) module determines whether static routes are available based on the BFD session status.</p>

<td class="cellrowborder" valign="top" width="38.6%" headers="mcps1.4.6.2.2.4.1.2 "><p>OSPF enables a device to periodically send Hello packets to a neighboring router for fault detection. Detecting a fault takes more than 1s. As technologies become more advanced, voice, video, and other VOD services become widely used. These services are sensitive to the packet loss and delay. When the data transmission rate reaches the level of Gbit/s, such slow detection will cause a large amount of data to be lost. As a result, the requirement for high reliability of carrier-class networks cannot be met. BFD for OSPF is introduced to resolve this problem. After BFD for OSPF is configured in a specified process or on a specified interface, the link status can be rapidly detected and fault detection can be completed in milliseconds. This speeds up OSPF convergence when the link status changes.</p>

If OSPFv3 is associated with BFD sessions, BFD can notify OSPFv3 of link failures immediately. OSPFv3 then performs route calculation and convergence based on the new network topology.</p>

BFD for VRRP enables a master/backup VRRP switchover to be completed within 1 second, preventing user traffic loss. A BFD session is established between the master and backup devices in a VRRP group and is bound to the VRRP group. BFD immediately detects communication faults in the VRRP group and instructs the VRRP group to perform a master/backup switchover, minimizing service interruptions.</p>

<p>After a BFD for link-bundle session is bound to an Eth-Trunk interface, the system creates a dynamic unicast BFD sub-session for each Eth-Trunk member interface. Each sub-session independently negotiates and monitors the link status and reports the monitored link status. The system also creates a main session, which processes the link status reported by the sub-sessions and reports its status to the APP. The main session goes down only when all sub-sessions go down.</p>
