<h1 class="topicTitle-h1">Configuring the NFVI Distributed Gateway Function (BGP EVPN over E2E SR Tunnels)</h1>
<div class="taskbody"><p>In the NFVI telco cloud solution, the NFVI distributed gateway function allows UE traffic to be processed by vUGWs and vMSEs and transmitted over a DCN through E2E SR tunnels as well as being transmitted within a DCN in load balancing mode.</p>
<div class="context"><a name="EN-US_TASK_0172370587__1.4.1"></a><a name="1.4.1"></a>
<div class="p"><div class="p"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Usage Scenario</h4><p>The NFVI telco cloud solution uses the DCI + DCN networking. A large amount of UE traffic is sent to vUGWs and vMSEs on the DCN. After being processed by the vUGWs and vMSEs, the UE traffic is forwarded over the DCN to destination devices on the Internet. The destination devices send traffic to UEs in similar ways. To achieve these functions and ensure traffic load balancing on the DCN, you need to deploy the NFVI distributed gateway function.</p>
<p><a href="#EN-US_TASK_0172370587__fig_dc_vrp_evpn_cfg_014101">Figure 1</a> shows the networking of an NFVI distributed gateway (BGP EVPN over E2E SR tunnels). DC GWs, which are the border gateways of the DCN, exchange Internet routes with external devices over PEs. L2GW/L3GW1 and L2GW/L3GW2 are connected to VNFs. VNF1 and VNF2 that function as virtualized NEs are deployed to implement the vUGW functions and vMSE functions, respectively. VNF1 and VNF2 are each connected to L2GW/L3GW1 and L2GW/L3GW2 through IPUs.</p>
<div class="p">In NFVI distributed gateway networking (BGP EVPN over E2E SR tunnels), the number of BDs needs to be planned based on the number of network segments corresponding to each IPU. An example assumes that the four IP addresses planned for four IPUs belong to four network segments. In this case, four BDs need to be planned. You need to configure the BDs and the corresponding VBDIF interfaces on all L2GWs/L3GWs and bind all the VBDIF interfaces to the same L3VPN instance. In addition, the following functions need to be deployed on the network:<ul><li><p>Establish BGP VPN peer relationships between VNFs and DC GWs so that the VNFs can advertise UE routes (UE IP addresses) to DC GWs.</p>
</li><li><p>On L2GW/L3GW1 and L2GW/L3GW2, configure static VPN routes with the IP addresses of VNFs as the destination addresses and the IP addresses of IPUs as next-hop addresses.</p>
</li><li><div class="p">Deploy EVPN RRs which can be either a standalone device or a DC GW. In this section, BGP EVPN peer relationships are established between all L2GWs/L3GWs, PEs, and DC GWs, DC GWs are deployed as RRs to reflect EVPN routes, and other devices function as RR clients. The functions of a BGP EVPN RR are as follows:<ul><li><p>DC GWs can reflect the UE routes learned by VNFs to L2GWs/L3GWs and PEs so that UE routes can be transmitted outside the DCN and the traffic sent to UE users can be imported into the DCN. Route-policies need to be configured on DC GWs so that the UE routes sent by DC GWs to L2GWs/L3GWs and PEs carry the gateway IP addresses which are VNFs' loopback addresses.</p>
</li><li><p>DC GWs receive the IP prefix routes destined for VNFs from an L2GW/L3GW based on BGP EVPN peer relationships and reflect the IP prefix routes to PEs and other L2GWs/L3GWs. The EVPN RR can also be used to synchronize the MAC or ARP routes of IPUs and the IP prefix routes destined for VNFs between L2GWs/L3GWs.</p>
</li></ul>
</div>
</li><li><p>Configure static default routes on PEs and use the EVPN RRs to reflect the static default routes to L2GWs/L3GWs.</p>
</li><li><p>Deploy SR tunnels between PEs and L2GWs/L3GWs and between DC GWs and L2GWs/L3GWs to carry service traffic.</p>
</li><li><p>The traffic transmitted between UEs and the Internet over VNFs is north-south traffic. The traffic transmitted between VNF1 and VNF2 is east-west traffic. To achieve load balancing of east-west traffic and north-south traffic, deploy the load balancing function on DC GWs and L2GWs/L3GWs.</p>

<h4 class="sectiontitle">Pre-configuration Tasks</h4><p>Before configuring the NFVI distributed gateway function, complete the following tasks:</p>
<ul><li><p>Allow the routes between PEs and DC GWs and between DC GWs and L2GWs/L3GWs to be reachable.</p>
</li><li><p>Deploy SR tunnels between PEs and L2GWs/L3GWs and between DC GWs and L2GWs/L3GWs.</p>
</li><li><p>Configure BD EVPN on PEs, DC GWs, and L2GWs/L3GWs. The configuration includes creating EVPN instances and L3VPN instances, establishing BGP EVPN peer relationships, and configuring VBDIF interfaces. On DC GWs, the configuration involves only creating L3VPN instances and establishing BGP EVPN peer relationships.</p>
</li><li><p>Configure the static routes destined for VNF1 and VNF2 on L2GWs/L3GWs by referring to <a href="dc_vrp_static-route_disjoin_cfg_0004.html">Static VPN IPv4 Routes</a> or <a href="dc_vrp_static-route_disjoin_cfg_0009.html">Static VPN IPv6 Routes</a>.</p>
