<div><p>Multiple physical interfaces can be bundled into an Eth-Trunk interface using the link aggregation technique. The Eth-Trunk interface is a logical interface, having all functions of an Ethernet interface and is more reliable.</p>
<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Brief Introduction</h4><p>As the volume of services deployed on networks increases, the bandwidth provided by a single P2P physical link working in full-duplex mode cannot meet the requirements of service traffic.</p>
<p>To increase bandwidth, existing interface boards can be replaced with interface boards of higher bandwidth capacity. However, this would waste existing device resources and increase upgrade expenditure. If more links are used to interconnect devices, each Layer 3 interface must be configured with an IP address, wasting IP addresses.</p>
<p>To increase bandwidth without replacing the existing interface boards or wasting IP address resources, bundle physical interfaces into a logical interface using Eth-Trunk to provide higher bandwidth.</p>
</div>

<p>All member interfaces forward data and perform load balancing.</p>
<p>In manual load balancing mode, traffic can be evenly distributed among all member interfaces. Alternatively, you can set different weights for member interfaces to implement uneven load balancing. The interfaces set with greater weights transmit more traffic.</p>
<p>If an active link fails, the remaining active links in the LAG share the traffic evenly or based on the weight.</p>

This mode is also called M:N mode where M indicates the number of active links and N indicates the number of backup links. This mode improves link reliability and implements load balancing among the M active links.</p>
<p>In static LACP mode, you also manually create a trunk interface and add member interfaces to it. Compared with link aggregation in manual load balancing mode, active interfaces in LACP mode are selected through the transmission of Link Aggregation Control Protocol Data Units (LACPDUs). This means that when a group of interfaces are added to a trunk interface, the status of each member interface (active or inactive) depends on the LACP negotiation.</p>
<p><span>When data is transmitted over the aggregation link, traffic is distributed among the active (M) links. No data is transmitted over the backup (N) links. Therefore, the actual bandwidth of the aggregation link is the sum of the bandwidth of the M links, and the maximum bandwidth that can be provided is the sum of the bandwidth of M + N links.</span></p>
<p>If one of the M links fails, LACP selects one available backup link from the N links to replace the faulty link. In this situation, the actual bandwidth of the aggregation link remains the sum of the bandwidth of M links, but the maximum bandwidth that can be provided is the sum of the bandwidth of M + N - 1 links.</p>

To ensure data transmission, you can run the <a href="cmdqueryname=lacp+timeout"><b><span class="cmdname">lacp timeout</span></b></a> command to configure the timeout period for the interface to receive packets. If a local member interface does not receive any LACP packet within the configured timeout period, it turns down immediately and no longer forwards data.</p>
<p>As the number of up member interfaces does not fall below the configured minimum number of up member interfaces, the Eth-Trunk interface is still up. In this case, data is balanced between the two member interfaces in the up state, thereby ensuring the reliability of data transmission.</p>
