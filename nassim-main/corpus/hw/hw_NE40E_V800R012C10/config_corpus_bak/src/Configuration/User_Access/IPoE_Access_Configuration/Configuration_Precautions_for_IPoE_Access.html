<p>1. If multiple DHCPv6 servers are configured in a DHCPv6 server group, and some DHCPv6 servers belong to the same VPN instance as the user and some do not belong to the same VPN instance as the user, the VPN instance carried in the response packet sent by the DHCPv6 server to the BRAS is the user's VPN instance. Therefore, the user considers that: The DHCPv6 server that belongs to the same VPN as the user is reachable and is recorded in the DHCPv6 server information in the user table. When the BRAS receives a renewal packet, it uses the DHCPv6 server information recorded in the user entry to send a packet to the DHCPv6 server. If the DHCPv6 server is unreachable, the renewal fails. In this case, the BRAS needs to send a rebind packet to renew the lease. </p>
<p>2. If multiple DHCPv6 servers are configured in a DHCPv6 server group and the VPNs to which the DHCPv6 servers belong are different from the VPNs to which users belong, the response packets sent by the DHCPv6 servers to the BRAS carry the users' VPNs, the BRAS matches the user's VPN instance in the response packet with the VPN instance on the DHCPv6 server. The VPN instance on the BRAS is different from that on the DHCPv6 server. As a result, the user fails to go online. </p>
<p>The preceding implementation affects user access and lease renewal in the DHCPv6 server group working in polling mode. </p>
<p>It is recommended that the DHCPv6 server and the user be configured with the same VPN or only one DHCPv6 server be configured in a DHCPv6 server group.</p>

<p>1. In dual-device hot backup scenarios, the configurations on the master and backup devices must be consistent.</p>
<p>2. In the dual-device hot backup non-load balancing scenario, a user goes online from the master device but is not triggered to go online from the backup device. In this case, if a master/backup device switchover occurs and the CPE updates its MAC address, the CPE may need to dial up multiple times for a successful login. In the dual-device hot backup load balancing scenario, the CPE may need to dial up multiple times for a successful login after updating its MAC address.</p>
<p>Cause: When an online user is waiting to be triggered to go online from the backup device, a master/backup device switchover is performed, and the user uses a different MAC address for dialup. The backup device becomes the master device. After receiving a new login request from the user, the device logs out the new user when the existing user is triggered to go online. The new user needs to dial up again to log out the existing user before the new user can log in.</p>
