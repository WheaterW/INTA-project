Overview of Basic IP Routing
============================

To forward data, routers must be capable of establishing and refreshing routing tables and forwarding datagrams based on routing tables.

#### Definition

As a basic concept on data communication networks, routing is the process of packet relaying or forwarding, and the process provides route information for packet forwarding.


#### Purpose

During data forwarding, routers, routing tables, and routing protocols are indispensable. Routing protocols are used to discover routes and contribute to the generation of routing tables. Routing tables store the routes discovered by various routing protocols, and routers select routes and implement data forwarding.
