Overview of IPv6 Static Routes
==============================

Configuring IPv6 static routes can implement the interworking of simple networks.

#### Definition

Static routes are special routes that are configured by network administrators.


#### Purpose

On a simple network, only static routes can ensure that the network runs properly. If a router cannot run dynamic routing protocols or cannot generate routes to a destination network, you can configure static routes on the router.

Route selection can be controlled using static routes. Properly configuring and using static routes can improve network performance and guarantee the required bandwidth for important applications. When a network fault occurs or the network topology changes, however, static routes must be changed manually by the administrator.
