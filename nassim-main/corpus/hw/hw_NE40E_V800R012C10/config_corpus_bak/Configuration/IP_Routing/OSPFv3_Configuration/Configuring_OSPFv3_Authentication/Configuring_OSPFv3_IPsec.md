Configuring OSPFv3 IPsec
========================

OSPFv3 IPsec provides a set of IPsec mechanisms to authenticate sent and received OSPFv3 packets, protecting devices against invalid OSPFv3 packets.

#### Usage Scenario

OSPFv3 IPsec uses a set of IPsec mechanisms to authenticate sent and received OSPFv3 packets, protecting devices against invalid OSPFv3 packets.


[Configuring an IPsec Proposal](../../../../software/nev8r10_vrpv8r16/user/vrp/dc_vrp_ospfv3_cfg_2071.html)

Proposal defines encryption and authentication algorithms to authenticate OSPFv3 protocol packets.

[Configuring an IPsec SA](../../../../software/nev8r10_vrpv8r16/user/vrp/dc_vrp_ospfv3_cfg_2072.html)

To create a manual IPsec tunnel, you need to use the SPI, string-key, authentication-hex, or encryption-hex.

[Enabling OSPFv3 IPsec](../../../../software/nev8r10_vrpv8r16/user/vrp/dc_vrp_ospfv3_cfg_2073.html)

A Security Association (SA) configured in an OSPFv3 process or OSPFv3 area is used to authenticate packets of the process.
