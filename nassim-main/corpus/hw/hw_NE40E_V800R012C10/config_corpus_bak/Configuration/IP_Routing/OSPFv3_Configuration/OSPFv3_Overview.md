OSPFv3 Overview
===============

OSPFv3 uses the same basic implementation mechanism as OSPFv2 but is incompatible with OSPFv2.

#### Definition

Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) is a link-state Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP) developed by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).

OSPF version 2 (OSPFv2) is intended for IPv4, and OSPF version 3 (OSPFv3) is intended for IPv6.

* OSPFv3 is short for OSPF version 3.
* OSPFv3 runs over IPv6.
* OSPFv3 is an enhanced version of OSPFv2 but is an independent routing protocol.

#### Purpose

OSPFv3 is an extension of OSPF for support of IPv6.
