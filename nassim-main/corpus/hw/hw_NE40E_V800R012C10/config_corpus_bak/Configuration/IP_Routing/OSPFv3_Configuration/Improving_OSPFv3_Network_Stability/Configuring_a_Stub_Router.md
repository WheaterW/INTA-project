Configuring a Stub Router
=========================

When the device is overloaded and cannot forward any other packets, you can configure it as a stub Router. After the Router is configured as a stub Router, other OSPFv3 devices do not use this device to forward data, but they can have a route to this stub Router.

#### Context

A stub Router controls traffic and instruct other OSPFv3 devices not to use it to forward data. Other OSPFv3 devices can have a route to the stub Router.

The link cost in the Router LSAs generated by the stub Router is set to the maximum value (65535).


#### Procedure

1. Run [**system-view**](cmdqueryname=system-view)
   
   
   
   The system view is displayed.
2. Run [**ospfv3**](cmdqueryname=ospfv3) [ *process-id* ]
   
   
   
   The OSPFv3 view is displayed.
3. Run [**stub-router**](cmdqueryname=stub-router) [[ **on-startup** [ *interval* ]] | [ **intra-area-prefix-lsa** ] | [ **external-lsa** [ *externallsa-metric* ]] | [ **inter-area-prefix-lsa** [ *interareaprefixlsa\_metric* ]]\*
   
   
   
   A stub Router is configured.
   
   
   
   The parameter **on-startup** [ *interval* ] specifies the interval during which the device remains a stub Router.

   The stub Router configured through this command has nothing to do with the Routers in a stub area.
4. Run [**commit**](cmdqueryname=commit)
   
   
   
   The configuration is committed.
