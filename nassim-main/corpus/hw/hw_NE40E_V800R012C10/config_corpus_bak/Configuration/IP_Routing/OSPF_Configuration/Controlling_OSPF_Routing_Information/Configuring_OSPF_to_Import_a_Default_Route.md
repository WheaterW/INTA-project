Configuring OSPF to Import a Default Route
==========================================

The default route is widely applied on the OSPF network to reduce routing entries in the routing table and filter specific routing information.

#### Context

On the area border and AS border of an OSPF network generally reside multiple Routers for next-hop backup or traffic load balancing. A default route can be configured to reduce routing entries and improve resource usage on the OSPF network.

OSPF default routes are generally applied to the following scenarios:

1. An ABR in an area advertises Type 3 LSAs carrying the default route within the area. Routers in the area use the received default route to forward inter-area packets.
2. An ASBR in an AS advertises Type 5 or Type 7 LSAs carrying the default route within the AS. Routers in the AS use the received default route to forward AS external packets.

When no exactly matched route is discovered, the Router can forward packets through the default route.

The priorities of the default routes corresponding to Type 3 LSAs are higher than those of the routes corresponding to Type 5 or Type 7 LSAs.

The rules for advertising default routes in different types of OSPF areas vary, as shown in [Table 1](#EN-US_TASK_0172365575__tab_dc_vrp_ospf_cfg_204101).

**Table 1** Default route advertising mode
| Area Type | Generated By | Advertised By | LSA Type | Flooding Area |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Common area | The [**default-route-advertise**](cmdqueryname=default-route-advertise) command | ASBR | Type 5 LSA | Common area |
| Stub area | Automatically | ABR | Type 3 LSA | Stub area |
| NSSA | The [**nssa**](cmdqueryname=nssa) [ **default-route-advertise** ] command is run. | ASBR | Type 7 LSA | NSSA |
| Automatically | ABR | Type 7 LSA | NSSA |
| Totally NSSA | Automatically | ABR | Type 3 LSA | NSSA |

Perform the following operations on the Router that functions as the ASBR running OSPF:


#### Procedure

1. Run [**system-view**](cmdqueryname=system-view)
   
   
   
   The system view is displayed.
2. Run [**ospf**](cmdqueryname=ospf) [ *process-id* ]
   
   
   
   The OSPF view is displayed.
3. Run [**default-route-advertise**](cmdqueryname=default-route-advertise) [ [ **always** | **permit-calculate-other** ] | **cost** *costvalue* | **type** *typevalue* | { **route-policy** *route-policy-name* | **route-filter** *route-filter-name* } | **distribute-delay** *delay-time* ] \* or **default-route-advertise** [ **permit-calculate-other** | **cost** *costvalue* | **type** *typevalue* | { **route-policy** *route-policy-name* | **route-filter** *route-filter-name* } | **distribute-delay** *delaytimer* | **permit-ibgp** | **tag** *tagvalue* | **permit-preference-less-than** *preference-val* ] \*
   
   
   
   The device is configured to import default routes to the OSPF process.

   To prevent low-priority active default routes from being imported, which would otherwise cause routing loops, you are advised to specify the **permit-preference-less-than** parameter. This parameter is used only when **always** is not specified.
   
   For details about how to configure a default route in an NSSA, see [Configuring an OSPF NSSA](dc_vrp_ospf_cfg_2015.html).
4. Run [**commit**](cmdqueryname=commit)
   
   
   
   The configuration is committed.
