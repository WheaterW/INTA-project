Configuring an IP Prefix List
=============================

An IP prefix list filters routes based on the destination addresses of the routes.

#### Usage Scenario

To control route reception and advertisement based on the destination addresses of routes, you need to configure an IP prefix list.

The address prefix is a mandatory attribute of all routes and can be flexibly used in various networking modes.
