Configuring Route Exchange Between a PE and a CE
================================================

An IPv6 routing protocol needs to be configured on a PE and a CE to enable them to learn IPv6 routes from each other.

#### Context

The routing protocol running between a PE and a CE can be EBGP, IBGP, IPv6 static route, OSPFv3, RIPng, or IS-IS. You can select one of them as required. For details, see the configuration of each routing protocol in the *HUAWEI NE40E-M2 seriesUniversal Service Router Configuration Guide - IP Routing*.
