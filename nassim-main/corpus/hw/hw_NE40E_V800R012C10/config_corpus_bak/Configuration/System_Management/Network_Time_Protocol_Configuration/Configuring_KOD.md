Configuring KOD
===============

This section describes how to configure Kiss-o'-Death (KOD) feature and its operation in different modes.

#### Usage Scenario

NTP has the following operation modes:

* Client/server mode
* Peer mode
* Multicast mode
* Manycast mode

KOD is inapplicable to broadcast and multicast mode.![](../../../../public_sys-resources/note_3.0-en-us.png) 

KOD is applicable only to NTP version 4.




#### Pre-configuration Tasks

Before configuring NTP KOD, complete the following tasks:

* Configure the link layer protocol for the interface.
* Configuring the network layer address and routing protocol to make the server and client reachable
