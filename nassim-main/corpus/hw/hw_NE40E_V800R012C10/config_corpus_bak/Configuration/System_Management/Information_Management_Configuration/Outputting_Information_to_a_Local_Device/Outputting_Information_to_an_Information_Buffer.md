Outputting Information to an Information Buffer
===============================================

An information buffer can store multiple latest information records generated by the system. You can set the size of the information buffer or the channel through which information is output to the information buffer.

#### Context

The system logs information about device operation in real time. You can check the information in an information buffer to know what happened to the device during the operation of the device and locate the fault cause.

In the document, logs and traps are output to an information buffer.



#### Procedure

* Output logs to the log buffer.
  1. Run [**system-view**](cmdqueryname=system-view)
     
     
     
     The system view is displayed.
  2. (Optional) Run [**info-center channel**](cmdqueryname=info-center+channel) *channel-number* **name** *channel-name*
     
     
     
     The information channel specified by *channel-number* is named *channel-name*.
  3. (Optional) Run [**info-center logbuffer channel**](cmdqueryname=info-center+logbuffer+channel) { *channel-number* | *channel-name* }
     
     
     
     The channel through which logs are output to the log buffer is configured.
  4. (Optional) Run [**info-center logbuffer**](cmdqueryname=info-center+logbuffer) **size** *buffersize*
     
     
     
     The size of the log buffer is set.
  5. Run [**info-center source**](cmdqueryname=info-center+source) { *module-name* | **default** } **channel** { *channel-number* | *channel-name* } **log** { **state** { **off** | **on** } | **level** *log-level* } \*
     
     
     
     Rules for outputting information through information channels are configured.
  6. Run [**commit**](cmdqueryname=commit)
     
     
     
     The configuration is committed.
* Output traps to the trap buffer.
  1. Run [**system-view**](cmdqueryname=system-view)
     
     
     
     The system view is displayed.
  2. Run [**info-center enable**](cmdqueryname=info-center+enable)
     
     
     
     Information management is enabled to output Trap information.
  3. Run [**info-center trapbuffer**](cmdqueryname=info-center+trapbuffer)
     
     
     
     The trap buffer function is enabled.
  4. (Optional) Run [**info-center channel**](cmdqueryname=info-center+channel) *channel-number* **name** *channel-name*
     
     
     
     The information channel specified by *channel-number* is named *channel-name*.
  5. (Optional) Run [**info-center trapbuffer**](cmdqueryname=info-center+trapbuffer) [ **channel** { *channel-number* | *channel-name* } ]
     
     
     
     The channel through which traps are output to the trap buffer is configured.
  6. (Optional) Run [**info-center trapbuffer**](cmdqueryname=info-center+trapbuffer) **size** *sizeValue*
     
     
     
     The size of the trap buffer is set.
  7. Run [**info-center source**](cmdqueryname=info-center+source) { *module-name* | **default** } **channel** { *channel-number* | *channel-name* } **trap** { **state** { **off** | **on** } | **level** *trap-level* } \*
     
     
     
     Rules for outputting information through information channels are configured.
  8. Run [**commit**](cmdqueryname=commit)
     
     
     
     The configuration is committed.
