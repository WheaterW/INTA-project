| Feature Requirements | Series | Models |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1. An AP does not support enabling telecom DCN in LLDP association mode.  (1) If a device has been configured as an AP, telecom DCN cannot be enabled through LLDP association.  (2) After a device configured with telecom DCN in LLDP association mode goes online as an AP, the telecom DCN configuration is automatically deleted.  2. Telecom DCN can be enabled using a PAF file or a license file. However, this method is not recommended because it has the following limitations:  A VLAN sub-interface 4094 is generated on the interface enabled with telecom DCN. If the telecom DCN configurations on the AP and master are different, there are the following limitations:  (1) When the AP's internal communication interface is the default telecom DCN interface and telecom DCN is not enabled on the master's internal communication interface, if the configuration delivered by the master's internal communication interface conflicts with the VLAN sub-interface 4094, the actual configuration of the AP's internal communication interface does not take effect. For example, add the master's internal communication interface to a trunk.  (2) When the AP's external communication interface is the default telecom DCN interface and telecom DCN is not supported on the master's extension interface, if the configuration delivered by the master's extension interface conflicts with the VLAN sub-interface 4094, the actual configuration of the AP's external communication interface does not take effect. For example, configure a VLAN sub-interface 4094 on the master's extension interface.  If telecom DCN is enabled on an AP, the AP's internal and external communication interfaces may fail to be added to a trunk, or the external communication interface cannot be configured using VLAN 4094 or sub-interface 4094. This affects service forwarding.  Do not use a device enabled with telecom DCN as an AP. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| Destination ports (listening) TCP ports 5432 and 1400, UDP ports 1400 and 1500, and source ports UDP ports 1405, 1400, 1401, and 1402 are well-known ports for the DCN feature and cannot be occupied by users. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| Security encryption for GNEs and NEs on a DCN:  1. To disable encryption for the channel between a GNE and an NE, you must configure the NE first and then the GNE. Otherwise, the NE cannot process the packets sent from the GNE.  2. After an NE is deleted, the NE cannot parse the encrypted packets sent by the GNE and discards the packets until channel encryption is deleted from the GNE. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| In transport mode, the DCN VLAN and service VLAN of a physical interface are mutually exclusive. The DCN VLAN of a physical interface cannot be configured on a sub-interface.  The following service VLAN commands are mutually exclusive with the dcn vlan command:  Commands on the main interface:  port default vlan  port trunk allow-pass vlan  Commands on sub-interfaces:  vlan-type dot1q  dot1q termination vid 6  Service VLANs that are configured later cannot be configured. Plan the VLAN properly. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| A GNE can be managed by a maximum of 17 NMSs. If there are more than 17 NMSs, the NMSs cannot manage NEs through the QX.  Wait until invalid TCP connections are torn down due to timeout. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| Destination ports (listening) TCP ports 5432 and 1400, UDP ports 1400 and 1500, and source ports UDP 1400 and 1401/1402 are well-known ports for the DCN feature and cannot be occupied by users. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
