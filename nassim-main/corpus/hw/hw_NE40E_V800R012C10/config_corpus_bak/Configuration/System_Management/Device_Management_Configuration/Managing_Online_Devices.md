Managing Online Devices
=======================

Manage online devices to ensure that the network works normally.

#### Usage Scenario

You can manage online devices by checking information about the device or resetting a board to ensure that the network works normally.


#### Pre-configuration Tasks

Before managing online devices, power on the Router and start it.


[Checking Device Versions](../../../../software/nev8r10_vrpv8r16/user/ne/dc_ne_dev_cfg_0023.html)

You can check the system software version and hardware and software versions of each component.

[Checking Basic Device Information](../../../../software/nev8r10_vrpv8r16/user/ne/dc_ne_dev_cfg_0024.html)

You can check basic information about the device, including the status of all boards and basic information about a module (for example, power module or fan module) in a certain slot.

[Checking Electronic Labels](../../../../software/nev8r10_vrpv8r16/user/ne/dc_ne_dev_cfg_0006.html)

By checking the electronic label of a board, you can obtain the type, bar code, Bill of Material (BOM) code, description, production date, supplier name, issuing number, Common Language Equipment Identification (CLEI) code, and sales BOM code of the board.

[Activating and Viewing Digital Warranties](../../../../software/nev8r10_vrpv8r16/user/vrp/dc_vrp_dev_cfg_warranty.html)

Digital warranties record the service life of devices and components. Users can activate and view the digital warranties on devices.

[Checking the Software Package ID](../../../../software/nev8r10_vrpv8r16/user/vrp/dc_vrp_dev_cfg_0019.html)

A software package ID uniquely identifies a software package and is the same as the software package name released on the software package release platform.

[Checking Memory Usage](../../../../software/nev8r10_vrpv8r16/user/vrp/dc_vrp_dev_cfg_0011.html)

During the routine maintenance of the device or when the device cannot run normally, you can check the memory usage and the memory usage configuration.

[Checking CPU Usage](../../../../software/nev8r10_vrpv8r16/user/vrp/dc_vrp_dev_cfg_0012.html)

During the routine maintenance of the device or when the device cannot run normally, you can check the CPU usage and the CPU usage configuration.

[Checking the Usage of System Process Resources](../../../../software/nev8r10_vrpv8r16/user/vrp/dc_vrp_dev_cfg_0018.html)

This section describes how to check the usage of system process resources in routine maintenance.

[Checking Device Temperatures](../../../../software/nev8r10_vrpv8r16/user/ne/dc_ne_dev_cfg_0011.html)

By checking device temperatures, you can view the current temperature status, temperature alarm threshold, and actual temperature of each board.

[Checking Device Voltages](../../../../software/nev8r10_vrpv8r16/user/ne/dc_ne_dev_cfg_0012.html)

By checking the voltage status of each board on the device, you can know the number of voltage sensors for boards, working status of the voltage sensors, alarm threshold of voltage, and actual voltage.

[Checking Power Modules](../../../../software/nev8r10_vrpv8r16/user/ne/dc_ne_dev_cfg_0013.html)

You can check information about the power modules on a device, including their slot IDs, installation status, working modes, and cable status. 

[Checking the Channel Status in the System](../../../../software/nev8r10_vrpv8r16/user/ne/dc_ne_dev_cfg_6010.html)

You can check the channel status in the system to determine whether the system is running properly.

[Restarting the Device](../../../../software/nev8r10_vrpv8r16/user/ne/dc_ne_dev_cfg_0025.html)

After the software of a device is upgraded, restart the device to validate the configurations.

[Resetting a Board](../../../../software/nev8r10_vrpv8r16/user/ne/dc_ne_dev_cfg_0026.html)

During device maintenance, you can use a certain command to reset a board. Before resetting a board, you need to save the configuration file on the board to ensure that the configuration can automatically recover after the board is reset.

[Checking Board Resource Usage](../../../../software/nev8r10_vrpv8r16/user/ne/dc_ne_dev_cfg_7000.html)



[(Optional) Configuring Memory Usage Reliability](../../../../software/nev8r10_vrpv8r16/user/ne/dc_ne_dev_cfg_reli2.html)

You can configure memory usage reliability based on service deployment on the device. In this way, when the memory usage of the device is too high, the device can detect the high memory usage in a timely manner and release memory to prevent unexpected board resets.

[(Optional) Configuring CPU Usage Alarm Thresholds and a Detection Period](../../../../software/nev8r10_vrpv8r16/user/ne/dc_ne_dev_cfg_reli3.html)

You can configure the CPU usage alarm thresholds and a detection period based on service deployment on the device. Alarm thresholds include the level-1 alarm triggering threshold, level-1 alarm clearing threshold, level-2 alarm triggering threshold, and level-2 alarm clearing threshold.
