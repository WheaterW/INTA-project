#### Usage Scenario

By default, the automatic clock source selection algorithm can be used to determine a clock source to be traced for system or 2M phase-locked loop (PLL) clocks. You can also manually or forcibly specify a clock source to be traced based on the quality level of each clock source.

On a clock synchronization network, if the status or quality of clock sources cannot remain stable for a long time, you are advised to configure the automatic clock source selection mode to ensure that the device can trace the optimal clock source. Manual and forcible clock source selection modes do not support automatic protection switching of clock sources.
