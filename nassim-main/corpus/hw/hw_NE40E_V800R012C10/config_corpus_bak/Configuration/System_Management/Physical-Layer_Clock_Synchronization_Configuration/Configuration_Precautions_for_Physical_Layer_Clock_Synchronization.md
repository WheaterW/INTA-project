| Feature Requirements | Series | Models |
| --- | --- | --- |
| On 10GE interfaces of a CX68L1XE8GF subcard, hop-by-hop 1588 frequency synchronization is not supported and must be used together with synchronous Ethernet.  Restrictions on subcards: Do not use these types of subcards to configure hop-by-hop 1588 frequency synchronization. You can use substitute boards to implement PTP frequency synchronization.  Note: CX68L1XE8GFB can replace CX68L1XE8GF.  Deploying both 1588 and synchronous Ethernet is recommended. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2K-B |
| On 10GE interfaces of a CX68L2XFB subcard, hop-by-hop 1588 frequency synchronization is not supported and must be used together with synchronous Ethernet.  Restrictions on subcards: Do not use these types of subcards to configure hop-by-hop 1588 frequency synchronization. You can use substitute boards to implement PTP frequency synchronization.  Note: CX68L2XFC can replace CX68L2XFB.  Deploying both 1588 and synchronous Ethernet is recommended. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K-B |
| When the 2M ring does not trace the source, the output action ("clock bits { bits0 | bits1 | bits2 } lti-action-2mbps { send-dnu | send-ais }") of the BITS port is valid only when the BITS signal type is set to 2mbps. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| The BP51-E 24x1GE subcard does not support synchronous Ethernet.  Involved subcard: ME0D0EFGFE7H.  Frequency synchronization deployment is affected.  You are advised to use synchronous Ethernet subcards instead. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2K-B |
| The CX68EEGFAE/CX68EAGFEA/CX68EEGFC in 100M mode does not support synchronous Ethernet or PTP time synchronization. If the 100M mode and clock services are configured at the same time, the hwClockPortNonSupport and hwPtpPortNonSupport alarms are reported. This affects clock/time synchronization deployment.  When planning the clock/time topology, do not deploy the clock/time source on the CX68EEGFAE/CX68EAGFEA/CX68EEGFC subcard in 100M mode. Instead, use the 1000M mode or other Ethernet subcards. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| The clock synchronization path does not exceed 20 hops, which affects the clock synchronization performance. It is recommended that the clock source be moved downwards to reduce the number of synchronization hops. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| In FlexE mode, if the bound logical interface (client) is faulty, the clock service fails. In this case, a clock source switchover is triggered. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| In FlexETH mode, the logical interface groups and clients bound to the upstream and downstream devices must be the same to ensure that bidirectional clock service flows are available. If they are inconsistent, clock services are unavailable and clock/time synchronization is abnormal.  You are advised to properly plan service configurations and ensure that the upstream and downstream logical interfaces are bound to the same group and client. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| The MPUP main control board does not meet the performance requirements of the G.8273.2 standard.  Plan services properly. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2K-B |
| The P51-E 24x1GE subcard does not support synchronous Ethernet.  Subcards involved: CR5D0EFGFE70/CR5DL2XEFG7E.  Frequency synchronization deployment is affected. It is recommended that synchronous Ethernet subcards be used as substitutes. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2K-B |
| In the port extension scenario, the inter-device clock synchronization solution supports only physical-layer clock synchronization and 1588v2 time synchronization. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| O/E converters do not support synchronous Ethernet or PTP time synchronization. The frequency/time synchronization performance cannot be met.  When planning the clock/time topology, do not deploy the clock/time source on an interface with an O/E conversion module. Instead, use an optical module or an electrical interface. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| Synchronous Ethernet and 1588v2/G.8275.1 cannot be deployed on different subcards of the same interface board. They can be deployed on the same subcard or subcards of different interface boards. When Ethernet synchronization and 1588v2/G.8275.1 are deployed on different subcards of the same interface board, the system preferentially sends the 1588v2/G.8275.1 time source. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2K-B |
| A clock bundling group can be configured only on the clock link interfaces of two connected devices, and only one bundling group ID can be configured between two connected devices. Configuring the same bundling group ID for connected devices can automatically prevent loops. If two or more bundling group IDs are configured, you need to perform further configurations to prevent loops.  You are advised to properly plan services. Plan the links between two devices in the same bundling group, and plan the links between different devices in different bundling groups. (For example, in the DTA-DTB-DTC networking, plan all links between DTA and DTB in binding group 1, and plan all links between DTB and DTC in binding group 2.) | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| During network deployment, ensure that the transmit and receive optical fibers of each member link in a FlexETH group have the same length; otherwise, the clock synchronization performance is affected. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| The clock source with an abnormal frequency offset can participate in clock source selection again only when frequency offset detection is enabled and the frequency offset switching function is enabled. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| The clock feature can be configured only on some interfaces of the following subcards:  On 2x100G subcards, including CR5D00E2NC61, CR5D00E2NB60, and CR5D00E2NC62, only interface 0 supports the clock feature.  On 5x40GE subcards, including CR5D00E5MF6B, CR5D00E5MF61, and CR5D00E5MF61, only interfaces 0 and 1 support the clock feature.  On 20x10GE subcards, including CR5D00LEXF6B and CR5D00LEXF61, only interfaces 0 to 9 support the clock feature. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| The clock feature can be configured only on some interfaces of the following subcards:  On 2x100G subcards, including CR5D00E2NF71, CR5D00E2NF72, CR5D00E2NC78, and CR5D00E2NC79, only interface 0 supports the clock feature.  On 24x10GE subcards, including CR5D00LFXF74, CR5D0LFXFM70, and CR5D00LFXF76, only interfaces 0 to 11 support the clock feature.  On 20x10GE subcards, including CR5D00LEXF74, CR5D0LEXFE72, CR5D0LEXFE71, CR5D0LEXFE70, and CR5D00LEXF73, only interfaces 0 to 9 support the clock feature. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
