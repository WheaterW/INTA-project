| Feature Requirements | Series | Models |
| --- | --- | --- |
| The value of the <min-packet-length-value> parameter in the "car { <protocol-name> | index <index> | whitelist | whitelist-v6 | blacklist | user-defined-flow <flow-id> } { cir <cir-value> | cbs <cbs-value> | min-packet-length <min-packet-length-value> } \*" command can be set to a number ranging from 64 bytes to 9600 bytes. The range that takes effect is from 64 bytes to 8160 bytes. The minimum packet compensation value can be set to 8160 bytes at most.  You are advised to set the <min-packet-length-value> parameter properly. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| The priority fields (tos, dscp, and precedence) in the IPv6 CP ACL bound to CPU attack defense do not take effect. As a result, traffic does not match the priority fields. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| Due to the Loopback-Detect/loop-detect implementation mechanism, Layer 2 loops cannot be detected when they occur on the network.  In this case, Layer 2 loop detection and MAC flapping features can be used as substitutes. This function is mainly used in the deployment phase to determine whether a link is reachable. You are advised to disable this function after service cutover to prevent security risks. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| ACLs in local attack defense policies are not supported in the following scenarios:  1. Basic IPv4 ACL: If a rule contains time-range, the rule is delivered, but packets cannot be matched based on the rule.  2. Basic IPv6 ACL: If a rule contains time-range, the rule is delivered, but packets cannot be matched based on the rule.  3. Advanced IPv4 ACL: If a rule contains time-range and packet-length, the rule is delivered, but packets cannot be matched based on the rule.  If the protocol type in a rule is GRE, the rule is delivered, but GRE packets cannot be matched.  If the operator of the port number in a rule is neq (matching packets whose port number is not equal to the specified port number), the rule is not delivered.  4. Advanced IPv6 ACL: If a rule contains time-range and packet-length, the rule is delivered, but packets cannot be matched based on the rule.  If the operator of the port number in a rule is neq (matching packets whose port number is not equal to the specified port number), the rule is not delivered.  If the protocol type in a rule is gre(47) ipinip(4), the rule is delivered, but protocol packets of these types cannot be matched.  When a packet incorrectly matches an ACL, the corresponding action is performed. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| If address pool or port pool rules are configured based on a blacklist, whitelist, user-defined flow, or management protocol ACL, the rules become invalid temporarily in ascending order of priority when some addresses in the address pool or port numbers in the port pool are deleted or the port range is reduced. The number of invalid rules equals the number of deleted items. Traffic cannot match the rules.  You are advised to plan services properly. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| Due to the limitations of the TM module, the CX68NPU50/CX68NPU120/CX68MNPU80G series boards support only three-level (not four-level) scheduling for packets sent to the TM module.  You are advised to plan services properly.  The protocol suite associated through the protocol-group <group-name> cir <cir-value>, display cpu-defend protocol-group, and reset cpu-defend protocol-group command lines is actually a special processing performed at the software layer to shield the difference between level-3 scheduling and level-4 scheduling. Level-3 scheduling applies for only one GQ that is attached to 75 SQs. The hardware does not have the concept of protocol suite. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E |
| To prevent Tracert packet attacks, the device performs very small CPCAR-based rate limiting for packets from UDP ports 33434 to 33678 by default. The bandwidth for sending packets from UDP ports 33434 to 33678 to the CPU is low, which may affect other services using these ports.  You are advised not to use UDP ports 33434 to 33678 for services. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
