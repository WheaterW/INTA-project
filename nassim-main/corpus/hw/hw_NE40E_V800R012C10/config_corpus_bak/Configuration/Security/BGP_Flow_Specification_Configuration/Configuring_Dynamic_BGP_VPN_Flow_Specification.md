Configuring Dynamic BGP VPN Flow Specification
==============================================

Dynamic BGP VPN Flow Specification refers to the traffic control mode in which a traffic analysis server generates BGP VPN Flow Specification routes to control traffic in a VPN domain.

#### Usage Scenario

When deploying dynamic BGP VPN Flow Specification, a BGP VPN Flow Specification peer relationship needs to be established between the traffic analysis server and each ingress of the network to transmit BGP VPN Flow Specification routes.

In an AS with multiple ingresses, a Flow RR can be deployed to reduce the number of BGP VPN Flow Specification peer relationships and save network resources.

If you want to filter traffic based on the address prefix but the BGP VPN Flow Specification route carrying the filtering rule cannot pass validation, disable validation of BGP VPN Flow Specification routes received from a specified peer.


#### Pre-configuration Tasks

Before configuring dynamic BGP VPN Flow Specification, complete the following tasks:

* [Configure a VPN instance](dc_vrp_mpls-l3vpn-v4_cfg_0155.html) and [bind interfaces to the VPN instance](dc_vrp_mpls-l3vpn-v4_cfg_0156.html).

#### Procedure

1. Establish a BGP VPN Flow Specification peer relationship.
   1. Run [**system-view**](cmdqueryname=system-view)
      
      
      
      The system view is displayed.
   2. Run [**bgp**](cmdqueryname=bgp) *as-number*
      
      
      
      The BGP view is displayed.
   3. Run [**vpn-instance**](cmdqueryname=vpn-instance) *vpn-instance-name*
      
      
      
      A BGP-VPN instance is created, and the BGP-VPN instance view is displayed.
   4. Run [**peer**](cmdqueryname=peer+as-number) *ipv4-address* **as-number** *as-number*
      
      
      
      The IP address of a peer and the number of the AS where the peer resides are specified.
   5. Run [**quit**](cmdqueryname=quit)
      
      
      
      The BGP view is displayed.
   6. Run [**ipv4-flow vpn-instance**](cmdqueryname=ipv4-flow+vpn-instance) *vpn-instance-name*
      
      
      
      The BGP-Flow VPN instance IPv4 address family is enabled, and the BGP-Flow VPN instance IPv4 address family view is displayed.
   7. Run [**peer**](cmdqueryname=peer) *ipv4-address* [**enable**](cmdqueryname=enable)
      
      
      
      A BGP VPN Flow Specification peer is specified.
      
      
      
      After the BGP VPN Flow Specification peer relationship is established in the BGP-Flow VPN instance IPv4 address family view, the BGP VPN Flow Specification route generated by the traffic analysis server is imported automatically to the BGP routing table and then sent to the peer.
   8. Run [**commit**](cmdqueryname=commit)
      
      
      
      The configuration is committed.
2. (Optional) Configure a Flow RR.
   
   
   
   Before configuring a Flow RR, establish a BGP VPN Flow Specification peer relationship between the Flow RR and traffic analysis server, and between the Flow RR and each network ingress.
   
   
   
   1. Run [**system-view**](cmdqueryname=system-view)
      
      
      
      The system view is displayed.
   2. Run [**bgp**](cmdqueryname=bgp) *as-number*
      
      
      
      The BGP view is displayed.
   3. Run [**ipv4-flow vpn-instance**](cmdqueryname=ipv4-flow+vpn-instance) *vpn-instance-name*
      
      
      
      The BGP-Flow VPN instance IPv4 address family view is displayed.
   4. Run [**peer**](cmdqueryname=peer) *ipv4-address* [**reflect-client**](cmdqueryname=reflect-client)
      
      
      
      A Flow RR is configured, and clients are specified for it.
      
      
      
      The Router on which the [**peer reflect-client**](cmdqueryname=peer+reflect-client) command is run functions as a Flow RR, and the network ingress and traffic analysis server function as clients.
   5. (Optional) Run [**undo reflect between-clients**](cmdqueryname=undo+reflect+between-clients)
      
      
      
      Route reflection between clients through the RR is disabled.
      
      
      
      If the clients of a Flow RR are fully meshed, you can run the [**undo reflect between-clients**](cmdqueryname=undo+reflect+between-clients) command on the Flow RR to disable route reflection between clients through the RR, which reduces costs.
   6. (Optional) Run [**reflector cluster-id**](cmdqueryname=reflector+cluster-id) { *cluster-id-value* | *cluster-id-ipv4* }
      
      
      
      A cluster ID is configured for the Flow RR.
      
      
      
      If a cluster has multiple flow RRs, run this command to set the same *cluster-id* for these RRs.
      
      ![](../../../../public_sys-resources/note_3.0-en-us.png) 
      
      The [**reflector cluster-id**](cmdqueryname=reflector+cluster-id) command is applicable only to Flow RRs.
   7. Run [**commit**](cmdqueryname=commit)

      The BGP view is displayed.
   3. Run [**ipv4-flow vpn-instance**](cmdqueryname=ipv4-flow+vpn-instance) *vpn-instance-name*

   4. Run [**route validation-mode include-as**](cmdqueryname=route+validation-mode+include-as)
      
      
      
      The device is configured to check the AS\_Path attribute during BGP VPN Flow Specification route validation.
      
      
      
      BGP Flow Specification route validation is performed in either of the following modes:
      * Validation mode 1: After receiving a BGP Flow Specification route with a destination address-based filtering rule, the device checks the validity of the route using the rules described in [Figure 1](#EN-US_TASK_0172372348__en-us_cliref_0172383989_fig_route_validation-mode_include-as01). The route is considered valid only if the validation succeeds.
      * Validation mode 2: After receiving a BGP Flow Specification route with a destination address-based filtering rule, the device checks the validity of the route by checking whether the AS\_Path attribute of the route carries the AS\_Set and AS\_Sequence fields. The route is considered valid only if its AS\_Path attribute does not carry the AS\_Set or AS\_Sequence field.Validation mode 2 is configured using the [**route validation-mode include-as**](cmdqueryname=route+validation-mode+include-as) command. If this command is configured, the device checks the validity of a BGP Flow Specification route using mode 2 first.
      * If the validation succeeds, the BGP Flow Specification route is considered valid, and mode 1 is not used.
      * If the validation fails, the device checks the validity of the BGP Flow Specification route using mode 1.If this command is not run, the device uses mode 1 to check the validity of BGP Flow Specification routes.**Figure 1** BGP Flow Specification validation rules
