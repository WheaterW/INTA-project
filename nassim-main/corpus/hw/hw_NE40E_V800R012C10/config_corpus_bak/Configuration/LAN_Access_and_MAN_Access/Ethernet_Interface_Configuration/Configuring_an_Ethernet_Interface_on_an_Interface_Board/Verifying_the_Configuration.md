Verifying the Configuration
===========================

After an Ethernet interface is successfully configured, you can view information about the interface's IP address, MTU, working rate, working mode, type, and statistics about packets sent and received.

#### Procedure

* Run the [**display interface**](cmdqueryname=display+interface+gigabitethernet) **gigabitethernet** [ *interface-number* ] command to check the status of the specified Ethernet interface.
* Run the [**display transfer-mode**](cmdqueryname=display+transfer-mode) command to check the transmission mode of a specified 10GE LAN/WAN interface.
* Run the [**display wavelength-capability**](cmdqueryname=display+wavelength-capability) [**interface**](cmdqueryname=interface+interface-type) **interface-type** *interface-number* command to check the wavelength and frequency capabilities of the optical module on a specified interface.
* Run the [**display wavelength-map**](cmdqueryname=display+wavelength-map) command to check the mapping between channels and wavelengths.
