Verifying the Configuration
===========================

After centralized Network Address Translation IPv6-to-IPv4 (NAT64) for user traffic is configured, run display commands to verify centralized NAT64 configurations.

#### Prerequisites

A NAT64 translation has been configured.


#### Procedure

* Run the [**display nat64 instance**](cmdqueryname=display+nat64+instance) [ *instance-name* ] command to check the configuration of a NAT64 instance.
* Run the [**display nat user-information**](cmdqueryname=display+nat+user-information) command to check information about online users.
