Maintaining DS-Lite
===================

You can configure DS-Lite maintainability to improve the device administrator's capability to monitor DS-Lite services in real time.

#### Usage Scenario

DS-Lite maintainability functions are as follows:

* DS-Lite logs: Flow logs record DS-Lite user and translation information. They also help a device monitor and record private network access to public networks.
* DS-Lite alarms: A device can be configured to generate alarms if the number of established DS-Lite sessions or assigned DS-Lite ports reaches a specified alarm threshold. After obtaining alarm information, the device administrator can add DS-Lite boards or modify service configurations.
* DS-Lite statistics: A DS-Lite device collects statistics about DS-Lite packets that are forwarded, which helps improve the operating performance of DS-Lite.


#### Prerequisites

Before configuring DS-Lite maintainability, complete the following tasks:

* Configure basic DS-Lite functions.
* Configure DS-Lite translation for user traffic.
