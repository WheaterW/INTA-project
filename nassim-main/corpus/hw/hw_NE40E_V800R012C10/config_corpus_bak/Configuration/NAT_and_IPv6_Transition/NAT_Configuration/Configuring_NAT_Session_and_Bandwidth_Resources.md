Configuring NAT Session and Bandwidth Resources
===============================================

Configuring session and bandwidth resources is essential for dedicated NAT.

#### Usage Scenario

![](../../../../public_sys-resources/note_3.0-en-us.png) 

Only the NE40E-M2K and NE40E-M2K-B support this configuration.

Only dedicated boards support this configuration.

NAT session and bandwidth resources are under license control. By default, the device allocates neither NAT bandwidth nor session resources. Before you configure the NAT function, adjust NAT bandwidth and session resources.


#### Pre-configuration Tasks

Before you configure NAT session and bandwidth resources, complete the following tasks:

* The license has been loaded to the device, and the service board is working properly.

Session resources are essential for dedicated NAT.

[Configuring Bandwidth Resources](../../../../software/nev8r10_vrpv8r16/user/ne/dc_ne_nat_cfg_0006_1.html)

Bandwidth resources are essential for dedicated NAT.

[Verifying the Configuration](../../../../software/nev8r10_vrpv8r16/user/ne/dc_ne_nat_cfg_0008_1.html)

After you configure session and bandwidth resources for a dedicated board, you can check the resources assigned by the license.
