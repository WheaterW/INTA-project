Configuring the Priority of an ATM PVC
======================================

You can set priorities for ATM PVC traffic to define the
priorities of ATM users. In this manner, traffic can be scheduled
and guaranteed based on the priorities.

#### Usage Scenario

To ensure the bandwidth for
user services with different priorities in an ATM network, you can
configure the priorities of the traffic in ATM PVCs so that traffic
scheduling is performed based on the priorities.


#### Pre-configuration Tasks

Before configuring
the priority of an ATM PVC, complete the following task:

* Configuring the physical parameters of ATM interfaces to ensure
  normal operation of the interfaces
* Configuring IP addresses of the ATM interfaces

#### Configuration Procedures
