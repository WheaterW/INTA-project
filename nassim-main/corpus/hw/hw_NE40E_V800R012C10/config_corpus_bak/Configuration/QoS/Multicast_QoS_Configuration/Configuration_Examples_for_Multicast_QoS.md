Configuration Examples for Multicast QoS
========================================

This section provides multicast QoS configuration examples.

#### Context

![](../../../../public_sys-resources/note_3.0-en-us.png) 

To perform the multicast virtual scheduling, you only need to add some configurations on the Router on the basis of the existing network, and you do not need to change the networking and other configurations of the Router. Therefore, the following examples list only the configurations relevant to the multicast virtual scheduling.




[Example for Configuring Single-Edge Multicast Virtual Scheduling](../../../../software/nev8r10_vrpv8r16/user/ne/dc_ne_qos_cfg_013867.html)

This section provides an example for configuring single-edge multicast virtual scheduling in the case where a single device is used for both user access and multicast traffic forwarding.

[Example for Configuring Double-Edge Multicast Virtual Scheduling](../../../../software/nev8r10_vrpv8r16/user/ne/dc_ne_qos_cfg_013868.html)

This section provides an example for configuring double-edge multicast virtual scheduling in the case where one device is used for user access and the other device is used for multicast forwarding.
