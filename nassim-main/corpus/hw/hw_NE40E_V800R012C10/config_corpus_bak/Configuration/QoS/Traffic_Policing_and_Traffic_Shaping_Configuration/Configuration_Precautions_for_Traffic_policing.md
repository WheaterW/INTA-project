| After the port shaping or port-queue command is run on a trunk interface, the bandwidth is doubled based on the number of member interfaces. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| The CAR bandwidth is limited by the chip capability. The upper limit of the CAR bandwidth that takes effect is the maximum bandwidth of a board. If the configured bandwidth exceeds the maximum bandwidth, the maximum bandwidth takes effect.  The maximum bandwidth of the NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H board is 100 Gbit/s. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
