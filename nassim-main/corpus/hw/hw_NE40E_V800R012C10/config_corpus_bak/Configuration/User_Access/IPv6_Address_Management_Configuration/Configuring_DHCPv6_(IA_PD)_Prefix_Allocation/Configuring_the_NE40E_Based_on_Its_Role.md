Configuring the NE40E Based on Its Role
=======================================

This section describes how to configure the NE40E based on its role.

#### Context

DHCPv6 (IA\_PD) prefix allocation is used, and the NE40E acts as a delegating router. For details, see [Configuring a Delegating Router](dc_ne_ipv6_address_cfg_0071.html).

When the NE40E acts as a DHCPv6 relay agent, see [Configuring a DHCPv6 Relay Agent on the User Side](dc_ne_ipv6_address_cfg_0012.html).
