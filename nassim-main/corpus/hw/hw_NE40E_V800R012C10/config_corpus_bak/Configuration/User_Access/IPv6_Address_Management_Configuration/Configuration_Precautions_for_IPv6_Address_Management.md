#### Feature Requirements

**Table 1** Feature requirements
| Feature Requirements | Series | Models |
| --- | --- | --- |
| DHCPv6 and PPPoEv6 users with the same MAC address, PPPoEv6 users, and users with one MAC address but multiple sessions cannot be reserved based on MAC addresses. Do not deploy these services at the same time.  If the user has been online, the new user with the same MAC address cannot go online. If the user has been offline, the reserved address is occupied by the new user with the same MAC address. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| Address assignment based on the Option 18 or Option 37 attribute:  1. Prefixes in the delegation prefix pool configured using the dhcpv6-unshare-only command cannot be delivered by the RADIUS server.  2. Users with the same prefix cannot have the same EUI-64 address or the same interface ID negotiated using PPP. The second user with the same EUI-64 address or the same interface ID negotiated using PPP fails to go online. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| Reserved prefixes in the delegation prefix pool can be configured using the reserved prefix command. Reservation types include MAC address-based reservation, MAC address+lease-based reservation, DUID-based reservation, and DUID+lease-based reservation.  1. When ND is used to allocate unshared IPv6 prefixes, MAC address-based prefix reservation does not take effect for L2TP users because LNS-side users do not have MAC addresses. IPoE and PPPoE support only MAC address-based reservation. The other three reservation modes do not take effect.  2. When DHCPv6 uses IA\_PD options to allocate IPv6 prefixes to L2TP users, MAC address-based reservation and MAC address+lease-based reservation do not take effect.  3. Prefixes delivered by the RADIUS server cannot be reserved.  4. Prefix reservation is not supported when one MAC address maps to multiple sessions for PPPoE users. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| In V800R21C00, only real-time backup, not batch backup, can be configured in dual-device backup scenarios where DHCPv4 or DHCPv6 remote address pool lease proxy is deployed.  In V800R21C10 and later versions, real-time backup and batch backup can be configured in can be configured in dual-device backup scenarios where DHCPv4 or DHCPv6 remote address pool lease proxy is deployed. During RUI lease backup (real-time or batch backup), the RBS is disconnected and lease backup cannot be performed. During a master/backup device switchover, the device trusts the lease of the new master device. As a result, the lease of the device may be different from that of the client, and the user is logged out when the lease expires. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| In dual-device hot backup scenarios where a DHCPv4 or DHCPv6 local address pool is used, if the address pool's lease is changed when users are online, the lease is renewed on the master device but not on the backup device. If a short lease is changed to a long lease, users will be logged out when the lease expires after a master/backup device switchover.  Generally, the lease is modified in upgrade scenarios so that users can quickly detect link faults and go online again. The address pool lease is configured in the address pool view. Manually changing the lease configurations of all the address pools brings a huge workload.  To solve the preceding problems, run the dhcp upgrade command in the system view to modify the leases of all DHCPv4 user addresses.  To solve the preceding problems, run the dhcpv6 upgrade command in the system view to modify the leases of all DHCPv6 user addresses. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| Among physical interfaces, 40GE interfaces (interface 40GE x/x/x or interface 40GE x/x/x/x) do not support BRAS access. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
