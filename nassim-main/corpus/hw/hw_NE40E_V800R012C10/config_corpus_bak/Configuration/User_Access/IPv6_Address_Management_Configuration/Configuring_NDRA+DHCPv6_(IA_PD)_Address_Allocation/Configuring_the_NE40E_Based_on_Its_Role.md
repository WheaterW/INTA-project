Configuring the NE40E Based on Its Role
=======================================

This section describes how to configure the NE40E based on its role.

#### Context

When NDRA is used to allocate addresses to the WAN interfaces on a CPE, see [Configuring NDRA Address Allocation](dc_ne_ipv6_address_cfg_0020.html).

When DHCPv6 (IA\_PD) is used to allocate prefixes to a CPE, see [Configuring DHCPv6 (IA\_PD) Prefix Allocation](dc_ne_ipv6_address_cfg_0035.html).

In NDRA+IA\_PD address allocation, a DNS server must be configured for both the address pool for NDRA address allocation and the address pool for IA\_PD address allocation.
