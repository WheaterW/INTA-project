PPPoE Access Configuration
==========================

Point-to-Point Protocol over Ethernet (PPPoE) allows a remote access device to provide access services for hosts on Ethernet networks and to implement user access control and accounting. This chapter describes how to configure PPPoE and provides typical networking applications.

[Overview of PPPoE Access](../../../../software/nev8r10_vrpv8r16/user/ne/dc_ne_pppoe_cfg_0002.html)

Point-to-Point Protocol over Ethernet (PPPoE) is a link layer protocol that transmits PPP datagrams through PPP sessions established over point-to-point connections on Ethernet networks.

[Configuring PPPoE Access](../../../../software/nev8r10_vrpv8r16/user/ne/dc_ne_pppoe_cfg_0004.html)

Configuring PPPoE access allows access control and accounting for hosts.

[Configuring PPPoEv6 Access](../../../../software/nev8r10_vrpv8r16/user/ne/dc_ne_pppoxv6_cfg_0012.html)

In PPPoEv6 access mode, a terminal is required to support the PPPoEv6 dialup function.
