| The chasten function for PPPoE users takes effect only when MAC address-based user redial restriction is specified and one MAC address maps one session.  The chasten function for PPPoE users is implemented based on a specified board. If the master main control board for inter-board trunk users is switched, the number of dial requests must be recalculated.  After one-to-many mapping between one MAC address and many sessions is enabled, do not perform chasten for PPPoE users based on MAC addresses. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| The device cannot function as a PPPoE client. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| After the access-limit 1 command is run, restrictions on the function to log out an online user when a new user in the same VLAN goes online from the same BAS interface are as follows:  1. In dual-device hot backup scenarios, the configurations on the master and backup devices must be consistent.  2. In the dual-device hot backup non-load balancing scenario, a user goes online from the master device but is not triggered to go online from the backup device. In this case, if a master/backup device switchover occurs and the CPE updates its MAC address, the CPE may need to dial up multiple times for a successful login. In the dual-device hot backup load balancing scenario, the CPE may need to dial up multiple times for a successful login after updating its MAC address.  Cause: When an online user is waiting to be triggered to go online from the backup device, a master/backup device switchover is performed, and the user uses a different MAC address for dialup. The backup device becomes the master device. After receiving a new login request from the user, the device logs out the new user when the existing user is triggered to go online. The new user needs to dial up again to log out the existing user before the new user can log in. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| 1. The function to log out an online user when a new user in the same VLAN goes online from the same BAS interface takes effect only after the client-replace enable and access-limit 1 commands are run. This function takes effect for subsequent users.  2. After the function to log out an online user when a new user in the same VLAN goes online from the same BAS interface is enabled, if an unauthorized user in the same VLAN keeps dialing up on the BAS interface, the unauthorized user can log out an authorized user. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| Restrictions on the function to log out an online user when a new user in the same VLAN goes online from the same BAS interface:  For dual-stack users, if only one stack has specific configuration, the system considers that this function is not enabled for the user if the user goes online from the other stack first. As a result, the existing user cannot be logged out when this new user requests to log in.  Therefore, if this function is enabled for IPoE dual-stack user access and specific configuration exists on the interface, ensure that the following configurations coexist:  access-limit xx start-vlan xx [end-vlan xx] [qinq xx] user-type ipoe ipv4  access-limit xx start-vlan xx [end-vlan xx] [qinq xx] user-type ipoe ipv6 | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| Among physical interfaces, 40GE interfaces (interface 40GE x/x/x or interface 40GE x/x/x/x) do not support BRAS access. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
