Configuring a Console User Interface
====================================

A console user interface manages and monitors users who log in to a router through a console port.

#### Usage Scenario

To log in to a router through a console port for local maintenance, configure a console user interface, including physical attributes, terminal attributes, user levels, and authentication modes. You can configure parameters based on use and security requirements.

#### Pre-configuration Tasks

Before configuring a console user interface, log in to a Router through a console port.


[Configuring Physical Attributes for the Console User Interface](../../../../software/nev8r10_vrpv8r16/user/vrp/dc_vrp_basic_cfg_0008.html)

Physical attributes of the console user interface include the transmission rate, flow control mode, parity bit, stopbits, and databits for the console port.

[Configuring Terminal Attributes for the Console User Interface](../../../../software/nev8r10_vrpv8r16/user/vrp/dc_vrp_basic_cfg_0009.html)

Terminal attributes of the console user interface include the timeout period of an idle connection, number of rows displayed on a terminal screen, and buffer size for historical commands.

[Configuring a User Level for the Console User Interface](../../../../software/nev8r10_vrpv8r16/user/vrp/dc_vrp_basic_cfg_0010.html)

You can configure a user level for the console user interface to manage users based on their levels.

[Configuring an Authentication Mode for the Console User Interface](../../../../software/nev8r10_vrpv8r16/user/vrp/dc_vrp_basic_cfg_0011.html)

The system provides AAA authentication and password authentication to improve system security.

[Disabling the Console User Interface](../../../../software/nev8r10_vrpv8r16/user/vrp/dc_vrp_user-interface_0147.html)

The console user interface can be disabled if it is abnormal or needs to be paused due to some reasons.

[Verifying the Configuration of the Console User Interface](../../../../software/nev8r10_vrpv8r16/user/vrp/dc_vrp_basic_cfg_0012.html)

After configuring the console user interface, verify the configuration.
