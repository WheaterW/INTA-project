Configuring Login Through a Console Port
========================================

To configure a router that is powered on for the first time or locally maintain the router, log in to the router through the console port.

#### Usage Scenario

If a router is powered on for the first time, you can log in to the router only through the console port.

* If you cannot remotely access a device, you can locally log in to the device through the console port.
* If a device fails to start, you can log in to the device to diagnose the fault through the console port.

#### Pre-configuration Tasks

Before logging in to a router through a console port, complete the following tasks:

* Install a terminal emulator on a PC, such as PuTTY.exe.
* Prepare a console configuration cable.
