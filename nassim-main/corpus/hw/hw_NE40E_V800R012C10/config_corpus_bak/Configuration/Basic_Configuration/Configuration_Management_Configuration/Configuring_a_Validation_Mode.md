Configuring a Validation Mode
=============================

You can configure the immediate or two-phase validation mode for different reliability requirements.

#### Usage Scenario

Before configuring a service, you must enter a configuration view. After the configuration view is displayed, the system initiates the corresponding configuration transaction based on the configured validation mode. To immediately validate configurations, configure the immediate validation mode. To validate configurations after they are complete, configure the two-phase validation mode.


#### Pre-configuration Tasks

Before configuring a validation mode, log in to a device and enter the user view.
