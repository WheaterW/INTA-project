Managing Configuration Files
============================

You can manage configuration files, for example, set the configuration file to be loaded at the next startup or save the configuration file.

#### Usage Scenario

You can save the current configurations into the configuration file. After the system restarts, configurations can be restored.


#### Pre-configuration Tasks

Before managing configuration files, complete the following tasks:

* Power on a Router and ensure that it is working properly.
* Configure an account and an authentication mode.
* Configure a reachable route between the Router and a terminal.
* Log in to the Router.

[Saving Configurations](../../../../software/nev8r10_vrpv8r16/user/vrp/dc_vrp_cfgm_cfg_0023.html)

Configurations can be saved in a configuration file either automatically or manually.

[Comparing Configuration Files](../../../../software/nev8r10_vrpv8r16/user/vrp/dc_vrp_cfgm_cfg_0043.html)

You can compare the current configuration file with the configuration file for the next startup or a specified configuration file.

[Loading Configuration Files](../../../../software/nev8r10_vrpv8r16/user/vrp/dc_vrp_cfgm_cfg_0046.html)

To run commands in a batch for function configuration on a device that is properly running, load a configuration file to the device.

[Specifying the Configuration File to Be Loaded at the Next Startup](../../../../software/nev8r10_vrpv8r16/user/vrp/dc_vrp_cfgm_cfg_0022.html)

You can specify a configuration file to be loaded at the next startup of the system.

[Clearing a Configuration File](../../../../software/nev8r10_vrpv8r16/user/vrp/dc_vrp_cfgm_cfg_0024.html)

You can clear the configuration file that is loaded at the current startup of the system. This section describes how to clear the configuration file that has been loaded to a device and how to delete configurations from an interface at a time.

[Locking the System Configuration](../../../../software/nev8r10_vrpv8r16/user/vrp/dc_vrp_cfgm_cfg_0053_1.html)

This section describes how to lock the system configuration when multiple users manage a device at the same time. This operation avoids the inconsistency between the controller and forwarder.

[Using a Configuration Template to Deliver Configurations](../../../../software/nev8r10_vrpv8r16/user/vrp/dc_vrp_cli_cfg_0036.html)

Configurations in different views may be identical. To simplify the configurations, create a configuration template, define configurations that are duplicate in different views in it, and apply the configuration template to specified views.

[Viewing the Difference Between the Candidate Configuration and Current Running Configuration](../../../../software/nev8r10_vrpv8r16/user/vrp/dc_vrp_cfgm_cfg_0058.html)

This section describes how to view the difference between the candidate configuration and current running configuration before the candidate configuration is committed. If a configuration conflict is found, resolve the conflict before viewing the configuration difference.

[Verifying the Configuration of Configuration File Management](../../../../software/nev8r10_vrpv8r16/user/vrp/dc_vrp_cfgm_cfg_0025.html)

You can check information about a specified configuration file, the configuration file loaded at the current startup, or the configuration file to be loaded at the next startup.
