Displaying Shortcut Keys and Their Functions
============================================

You can use shortcut keys at any position where a command can be entered. After you use a shortcut key, the system displays the corresponding command on the screen. The result is the same as that of entering a complete command.

#### Context

If you enter an incomplete command and do not press **Enter**, using a shortcut key causes the system to delete the entered characters and display the corresponding command on the screen. The result is the same as that of entering a complete command.

Like the use of commands, the use of shortcut keys also enables the system to record the original command in the command buffer and logs for fault detection and query.


#### Procedure

1. Run [**display hotkey**](cmdqueryname=display+hotkey)
   
   
   
   The shortcut keys supported by the system and their functions are displayed.

   The functions of shortcut keys may be affected by the terminal in use. For example, when the user-defined shortcut keys conflict with the system shortcut keys on the Router, an entered shortcut key is captured by the terminal program and the corresponding command cannot be run.
