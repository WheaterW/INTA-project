Establishing a Command Line Running Environment
===============================================

Before using the CLI, you can establish a desired running environment for the CLI.

#### Usage Scenario

Before using the CLI to configure services, you can establish a basic running environment for the CLI to meet actual requirements.


#### Pre-configuration Tasks

Before establishing a running environment for the CLI, complete the following tasks:

* Install the Router and power it on.
* Log in to the Router through a PC.


[Configuring Header Information](../../../../software/nev8r10_vrpv8r16/user/vrp/dc_vrp_cli_cfg_0003.html)

When you access a Router, a message is displayed. You can configure desired content for the message.

[Configuring a Device Name](../../../../software/nev8r10_vrpv8r16/user/vrp/dc_vrp_cli_cfg_0007.html)

A device name is displayed at the command prompt. You can change a device name as required.

[Locking a User Interface](../../../../software/nev8r10_vrpv8r16/user/vrp/dc_vrp_cli_cfg_0031.html)

To prevent unauthorized users' access to a user interface, lock the user interface.

[Configuring the System to Allow the Execution of User-View Commands in the System View](../../../../software/nev8r10_vrpv8r16/user/vrp/dc_vrp_cli_cfg_0034.html)

To run commands that can be run only in the user view, you must return from the system view to the user view. After completing this configuration task, you can run these commands in the system view without returning to the user view.

[(Optional) Configuring the Command Timestamp Function](../../../../software/nev8r10_vrpv8r16/user/vrp/dc_vrp_cli_cfg_0039.html)

You can enable a device to record the date and time when commands are executed.
