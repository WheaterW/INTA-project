Configuring the Entropy Label for Tunnels
=========================================

The entropy label can be used to improve load balancing in traffic forwarding.

#### Usage Scenario

With the increasing growth of user networks and the extending scope of network services, load-balancing techniques are used to improve bandwidth between nodes. A great number of traffic results in load imbalance on transit nodes. To address the problems, the entropy label capability can be configured to improve load balancing performance.


#### Pre-configuration Tasks

Before configuring the entropy label for tunnels, [Enabling MPLS TE and RSVP-TE](dc_vrp_te-p2p_cfg_0004.html).


[Configuring an LSR to Deeply Parse IP Packets](../../../../software/nev8r10_vrpv8r16/user/ne/dc_ne_te-p2p_cfg_0004.html)

This section describes how to enable an LSR to deeply parse IP packets.

[Enabling the Entropy Label Capability on the Egress of an LSP](../../../../software/nev8r10_vrpv8r16/user/vrp/dc_vrp_te-p2p_cfg_0325.html)

The entropy label capability can be configured on the egress of an LSP to load-balance traffic.

[Configuring the Entropy Label for Global Tunnels](../../../../software/nev8r10_vrpv8r16/user/vrp/dc_vrp_te-p2p_cfg_0326.html)

The entropy label can be configured to global tunnels to improve load balancing performance.

[(Optional) Configuring an Entropy Label Capability for a Tunnel in the Tunnel Interface View](../../../../software/nev8r10_vrpv8r16/user/vrp/dc_vrp_te-p2p_cfg_0327.html)

The entropy label capability can be configured in the tunnel interface view to improve load balancing performance.

[Verifying the Configuration of the Entropy Label for Tunnels](../../../../software/nev8r10_vrpv8r16/user/vrp/dc_vrp_te-p2p_cfg_0329.html)

After configuring the entropy label for tunnels, you can verify entropy label information.
