FR Configuration
================

Frame Relay (FR) is a fast packet switching technology used to forward and switch data in a simple manner at the link layer. FR allows devices to communicate with each other through virtual circuits (VCs).

[Overview of FR](../../../../software/nev8r10_vrpv8r16/user/vrp/dc_vrp_fr_cfg_0002.html)

FR is a standard protocol for communication between devices at the data link layer. Multiple upper-layer protocols can be deployed on an FR-capable network.

[Configuring Basic FR Functions](../../../../software/nev8r10_vrpv8r16/user/vrp/dc_vrp_fr_cfg_0005.html)

FR uses VCs and works at the physical and data link layers of the OSI model. FR is characterized by high throughput and short delay and is applicable in case of burst service traffic.
