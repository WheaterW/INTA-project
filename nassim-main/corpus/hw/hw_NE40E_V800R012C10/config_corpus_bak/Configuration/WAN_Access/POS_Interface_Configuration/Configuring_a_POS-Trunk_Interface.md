Configuring a POS-Trunk Interface
=================================

Before configuring a POS-Trunk interface, familiarize yourself
with the usage scenario, complete the pre-configuration tasks, and
obtain the data required for the configuration.

#### Context

To configure APS on POS interfaces, create a POS-Trunk
interface and add the POS interfaces to the POS-Trunk interface.


#### Pre-configuration Tasks

Before configuring
a POS-Trunk interface, power on the devices and check that the self-check
succeeds.
