#### Feature Requirements

**Table 1** Feature requirements
| Feature Requirements | Series | Models |
| --- | --- | --- |
| If the mld enable command is run on the interface connected to users, PIM IPv6 must also be enabled; otherwise, multicast traffic cannot be forwarded.  It is recommended that PIM IPv6 be deployed on MLD-enabled interfaces. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| If you run the mld enable command on the interface connected to a user host, you must enable PIM IPv6. Otherwise, multicast traffic cannot be forwarded.  Deploying PIM IPv6 on MLD-enabled interfaces is recommended. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| In MLD dual-device hot backup E-Trunk mode, if multiple Eth-Trunk interfaces are bound to the same E-Trunk, performance cannot be ensured. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| [Restriction] Restrictions on BFD deployment in MLD dual-device hot backup scenarios:  1. If BFD is not configured or BFD does not track the downstream interface to monitor the link status, the switchover performance cannot be ensured if the downstream link or node is faulty.  2. In hot backup scenarios, BFD for link-bundle sessions cannot be configured to implement fast switchover. Such BFD sessions cannot track downstream AC interfaces.  3. In a VRRP6 dual-device hot backup scenario, the BFD session monitored by the VRRP6 group on the backup device must be a peer BFD session. Other BFD sessions cannot ensure fast switchover.  4. In an MLD dual-device hot backup scenario, E-Trunk/VRRP6 track BFD is used to monitor the status of the downstream Eth-Trunk interface. The BFD session state machine is abnormal when a board is faulty (reseated or removed) or a member interface link is faulty. As a result, access-side nodes have two master devices and two copies of traffic are received.  [Impact] The switchover performance cannot be ensured.  [Workaround]  1. In dual-device hot backup scenarios, it is recommended that BFD be deployed to monitor downstream links to implement fast switchover protection.  2. When member interfaces of an Eth-Trunk interface reside on different boards, create a BFD session group that contains two BFD sub-sessions. Services are aware of only the status of the BFD session group. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| In multicast MLD dual-device hot backup scenarios, when the upstream network-side link is configured in a monitor group and the downstream link is associated with the monitor group to detect the network-side link fault, the network-side link fault and downstream interface fault are processed by software. As a result, fast switching cannot be implemented, and the switching performance may be within seconds. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| [Restriction] E-Trunk dual-device hot backup for MLD services does not support master/backup switchover when an Eth-Trunk sub-interface is faulty.  [Impact] A master/backup switchover cannot be performed on the faulty Eth-Trunk sub-interface.  [Workaround] NA | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| When IPv4 and IPv6 dual-stack services are configured on an interface and both VRRP4 multicast hot backup and VRRP6 multicast hot backup are deployed, if one VRRP group tracks the mVRRP backup group in flowdown mode, the status transition of the other VRRP group is affected. As a result, the switchover performance cannot be ensured. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| [Restriction] In dual-device hot backup scenarios where VRRP6 protection is used for multicast MLD, you are advised to deploy common VRRP6 instead of mVRRP6 for master/backup protection. The mVRRP6 master/backup protection has the following restrictions:  1. Service VRRP6 tracks mVRRP6 and multicast services track mVRRP6 or service VRRP6. If the link where mVRRP6 resides is faulty, two copies of traffic occur or traffic cannot be forwarded.  2. When service VRRP6 tracks mVRRP6 in flowdown mode and multicast services track service VRRP6, the switchback performance of multicast services cannot be ensured.  3. When service VRRP6 groups deployed on different interfaces track the same mVRRP6 group, services on other interfaces are affected if one interface is faulty.  [Workaround] It is recommended that multicast track common VRRP6 hot backup protection be deployed. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| [Restriction] When multicast services track the master/backup protection of mVRRP6, if mVRRP6 is deployed on an Ethernet physical interface or virtual-Ethernet interface, the downstream link interface of the service must be deployed on the same board as the mVRRP6. Otherwise, two copies of traffic occur.  [Impact] Two copies of traffic occur.  [Workaround] It is recommended that mVRRP6 be deployed on logical interfaces such as Eth-trunk interfaces and VLANIF interfaces. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
