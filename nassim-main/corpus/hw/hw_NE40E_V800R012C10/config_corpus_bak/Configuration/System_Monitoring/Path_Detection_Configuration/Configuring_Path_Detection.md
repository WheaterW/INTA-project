Configuring Path Detection
==========================

There are two versions of DSCP-based path detection: one for IPv4 and one for IPv6.

#### Prerequisites

Before configuring path detection, ensure that a NETCONF connection has been established between the controller and device.


#### Context

To learn about the forwarding path of a specific flow on a network, O&M personnel can use the path detection function to restore the complete path through which the flow passes.


[Configuring DSCP-based IPv4 Path Detection](../../../../software/nev8r10_vrpv8r16/user/ne/dc_ne_cfg_path-detect_0004.html)

Configuring DSCP-based IPv4 path detection includes enabling path detection and constructing and forwarding an IPv4 path detection packet.

[Configuring DSCP-based IPv6 Path Detection](../../../../software/nev8r10_vrpv8r16/user/ne/dc_ne_cfg_path-detect_0005.html)

Configuring DSCP-based IPv6 path detection includes enabling path detection and constructing and forwarding an IPv6 path detection packet.
