NetStream Configuration
=======================

NetStream is a technique used to sample and distribute traffic information on networks. It collects statistics about traffic volume and resource consumption, helping users implement management and accounting on various services.

#### Context

![](../../../../public_sys-resources/note_3.0-en-us.png) 

The NetStream feature may be used to analyze the communication information of terminal customers for network traffic statistics and management purposes. Before enabling the NetStream feature, ensure that it is performed within the boundaries permitted by applicable laws and regulations. Effective measures must be taken to ensure that information is securely protected.



[Overview of NetStream](../../../../software/nev8r10_vrpv8r16/user/vrp/dc_vrp_ns_cfg_0001.html)

As the Internet develops rapidly, more bandwidth resources are provided for users, and at the same time a higher requirement for delicate network monitoring and management is raised. To address this issue, NetStream has been introduced. NetStream is a technique that collects highly granular per-flow traffic statistics. It classifies traffic flow statistics and calculates resource usage on networks. NetStream also helps monitor and manage networks based on the types of services and resources.
