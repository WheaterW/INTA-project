| --- | --- | --- |
| 1. This mode is used for Layer 3 multicast on the IPv4 public network and Rosen public network. When the control plane is stable, traffic is transmitted at a constant rate.  2. Due to errors, mtrace cannot be used to locate the fault in the scenario where a small number of packets are lost randomly.  3. Currently, only the (S, G) count and traffic rate statistics when the group address parameter is carried can be performed. The statistics when the group address parameter is not carried are not supported.  4. This command is not applicable to the scenario where the same (S, G) traffic passes through multiple upstream boards. The rate statistics are inaccurate. Therefore, you are advised not to run the mtrace command. For example, in the scenario where private network-based load balancing is performed on the ROSEN public network on a new board in NGSF mode.  5. If a device that does not allow traffic rate measurement to be performed exists on the MTrace link, the detection result of the device cannot be used as a reference.  6. During the active/standby switchover, the mtrace flow statistics are inaccurate and cannot be used for reference. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| In a public/private network accessing SRv6 scenario, if long packets are specified to initiate an ECMP trace test to check packet fragmentation, route selection is not performed in the SRv6 domain (because route selection is performed based on 3-tuple for fragmented packets, and the 3-tuple of fragmented packets remain unchanged). If there are multiple paths in the SRv6 domain, route selection is performed based on the hash result of the first fragment. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| In an IPv4/VPNv4 over SRv6 scenario, when an ECMP trace test is initiated on a PE with a large packet and a non-fragmentation flag specified, the MTU value in the too big error message is different from that of the outbound interface, the MTU value in the command output is the interface MTU value minus the Layer 2 header length, SRH header length, IP header length, and UDP header length. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| In an IPv6/VPNv6 over SRv6 scenario, when long packets are specified to initiate an ECMP trace test on a PE, the MTU value in the too big error message is different from the MTU value of the outbound interface. The MTU value in the command output is the interface MTU minus the Layer 2 header length, SRH header length, IP header length, and UDP header length. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| In an IPv4/VPNv4 over SRv6 scenario, when long packets are specified to initiate an ECMP trace test on a PE, no error message is displayed on the outbound interface of the P node. As a result, the first hop is successfully detected, and timeout is displayed on the second hop. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| In a VPNv6 over SRv6 scenario, when long packets are specified to initiate an ECMP trace test on a PE, no error message is displayed on the outbound interface of the P node. As a result, the first hop is successfully detected, but timeout is displayed on the second hop. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| In a VPN/IP over SRv6 scenario, a large packet is specified on the CE side to initiate an ECMP trace test. For security purposes, the SRv6 domain cannot respond to the CE side. Therefore, ICMP error packets cannot be sent in the SRv6 domain. As a result, the first hop is successfully detected, and timeout is displayed on the second hop. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| When the lossy mode and outward 802.1ag coexist and are bound to the same interface, the outward 802.1ag function is unavailable. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| In a cross-domain or private L3VPN detection scenario where a P node does not have any return route but supports MPLS forwarding, when the tracert ipv4 command is run to test an MPLS tunnel, the display of cross-domain P node information depends on whether the associated board supports tracert fast reply. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| Limitations on the ping function for BRAS user access in CU separation scenarios | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| When testing VPLS or VLL PWs with tunnel overlapping, L2VPN PW ping/tracert can test only the outer backup plane (in VPLS and VLL scenarios). | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| L2VPN PW ping/tracert can test a PW with only one segment, not a PW with multiple segments. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| The tracert lsp command is used to detect an LSP tunnel. Inter-AS P nodes are not supported. If timeout is displayed in the command output on an inter-AS P node, the tracert test skips the inter-AS P node and continues to detect the egress. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| In an EVPN/L3VPN over SRv6 TE Policy scenario, when the L3VPN mode is uniform and a tracert test is performed between PEs, information about intermediate hops is not displayed. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| For the ping/tracert ipv6-sid function, if the outbound interface of the End.OP SID does not have an IPv6 global address, the source address carried in the detection packet sent by the local end may be an unreachable IPv6 address. As a result, the test fails, but service traffic forwarding is not affected. You are advised to specify -a to initiate a test. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| In ping and trace tests, IPv6 SIDs support only unicast addresses. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| In a scenario where FRR is configured on the headend of an SRv6 TE Policy, ping/trace cannot be performed on the SRv6 TE Policy during FRR switching. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| In a segment-routing ping/trace test delivered by the NMS MIB, the default source address carried in the test packet sent by the local end may be an unreachable IPv4 address. As a result, the test fails, but service traffic forwarding is not affected. You are advised to specify a source address, for example, an LSR ID, to initiate a test. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| In EVPN VPLS MAC ping and EVPN VPWS ping/tracert inter-AS active-active scenarios, Huawei devices can interwork with only Huawei devices. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| 1. IPv6 addresses can only be set to global addresses but not link-local addresses.  2. The ICMP jitter IPv6 instance supports echo packets and does not support timestamp packets. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| 1. BIERv6 tracert allows return traffic to be transmitted through routes only, not through tunnels.  2. In load balancing scenarios, only one path can be detected.  3. A correct BSL must be specified. Otherwise, the tracert operation may fail.  4. BIERv6 tracert does not support packet fragmentation. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| 1. BIERv6 ping allows return traffic to be transmitted through routes only, not through tunnels.  2. In load balancing scenarios, only one path can be detected.  3. The specified target BFR IDs must be in the same set.  4. A correct BSL must be specified. Otherwise, the ping test may fail.  5. BIERv6 ping does not support fragmentation. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| During the detection of a PW path using a ping test, if the remote IP address is changed to be different from the peer IP address specified in the ping command, the result of the initiated ping test remains unchanged. You need to initiate a ping test again. Otherwise, the ping test result is affected. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
