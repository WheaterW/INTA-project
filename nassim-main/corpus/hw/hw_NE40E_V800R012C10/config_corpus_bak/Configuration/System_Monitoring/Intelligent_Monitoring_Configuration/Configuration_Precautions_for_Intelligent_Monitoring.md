| Feature Requirements | Series | Models |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Silent traffic fault identification monitors only Ethernet physical interfaces and FlexE interfaces. A maximum of 1500 ports can be monitored. Ports in the Down state cannot be monitored. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2K-B |
| The number of objects that can be monitored by the exception identification and resource prediction modules is limited. If the number of monitored objects reaches the upper limit and some objects are not monitored, the monitored module objects change after an active/standby switchover or restart of the system. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2K-B |
