Configuring NQA to Monitor a Layer 2 Network
============================================

Before configuring NQA to monitor a Layer 2 network, familiarize yourself with the usage scenario of each test instance and complete the pre-configuration tasks.

#### Usage Scenario

**Table 1** Usage scenario for monitoring a Layer 2 network using NQA
| Test Type | Usage Scenario |
| --- | --- |
| MAC ping test | A MAC ping test can be used to check the connectivity and measure the packet loss, delay, and other indicators of the link between any two devices on a Layer 2 network, facilitating fault locating. |



#### Pre-configuration Tasks

Before configuring NQA to check a Layer 2 network, complete basic configurations of the Layer 2 network.
