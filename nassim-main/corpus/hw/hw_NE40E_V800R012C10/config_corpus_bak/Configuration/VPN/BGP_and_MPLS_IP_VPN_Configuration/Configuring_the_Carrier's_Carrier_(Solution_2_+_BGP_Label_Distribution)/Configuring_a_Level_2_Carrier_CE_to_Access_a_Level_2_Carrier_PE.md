Configuring a Level 2 Carrier CE to Access a Level 2 Carrier PE
===============================================================

In the Level 2 carrier networking, for the CE's access to a PE, you need to create a VPN instance on the Level 2 PE and configure a routing protocol between the PE and CE, the configuration of which is similar to the configuration in the basic BGP/MPLS IP VPN.

#### Procedure

* For details, see the configuration of PEs and CEs in [Configuring a Basic BGP/MPLS IP VPN](dc_vrp_mpls-l3vpn-v4_cfg_0154.html).
