| Feature Requirements | Series | Models |
| --- | --- | --- |
| In an L2VPN over PWE3 scenario where inner and outer control words are carried on the egress PE, deep load balancing is configured on the egress PE. IP-based load balancing is not supported, and load balancing can be performed only based on labels. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| AC interface type: Only LDP is supported when VE interfaces are used for access. The BGP mode is not supported. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| In E-APS 1+1 mode, if an ICB PW fails, the CSG receives two copies of traffic.  LSP APS can be configured for ICB PWs. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K |
| EVC sub-interface accessing a VLL:  1. VLAN and Ethernet encapsulation configurations are supported, which do not affect the tag encapsulation of packets entering the public network. PW tags cannot be configured.  2. Separation of EXP priorities of public and private network labels is not supported.  3. Heterogeneous interworking is not supported.  4. The access SVC does not support hard pipes.  5. ETH-OAM services are not supported.  6. CCC is not supported. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| In an MC-PW APS scenario, E-APS works in 1:1 mode. After an ICB PW fails, services cannot be properly switched.  LSP APS can be configured for ICB PWs. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K |
| In an MC-PW APS scenario, the E-Trunk works in 1:1 mode. After an ICB PW fails, services cannot be properly switched.  LSP APS can be configured for ICB PWs. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K |
| The PW redundancy mode has the following restrictions:  BGP VLL does not support PW redundancy. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| The PW redundancy mode has the following limitations:  In the VLL accessing VPLS scenario, only the master/slave mode is supported. The independent mode is not supported. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| The VPWS flow label has the following restrictions:  1. GRE tunnels cannot be used as public network tunnels.  2. VLL services cannot use BGP signaling. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| VPWS heterogeneous interworking specifications: VPWS supports heterogeneous interworking. Only IPv4 packets are supported. Otherwise, traffic will be interrupted. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| VPWS supports GRE tunnels, but ICB PWs do not support GRE tunnels. Otherwise, traffic will be interrupted. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| The basic functions of single-ICB PW have the following limitations:  1. A single ICB supports only the 3PE scenario.  2. ICB PW faults are not supported.  3. Load balancing is not supported when traffic is transmitted over the ICB-PW.  4. LDP FRR is not supported. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| The basic single-ICB PW functions have the following restrictions:  1. When an E-Trunk is used, the E-Trunk delivers entries to multiple devices, and the sequence cannot be controlled. The AC switchback performance is affected by the E-Trunk convergence performance, and the specifications cannot be ensured. As a result, packet loss may occur for hundreds of milliseconds or several seconds, or the CSG may receive more packets than expected during the switchover.  2. If the E-Trunk is associated with BFD for mPW for fast updates, only the scenario where the proportion of E-Trunk:Eth-Trunk:trunk member is 1:1:1 is supported. The scenario where an E-Trunk has multiple Eth-Trunks or a trunk has multiple members is not supported. If BFD for mPW is associated with the E-Trunk and the BFD session goes down, the lower-layer trunk is quickly switched.  If the ICB PW flaps, BFD flaps. As a result, the master/backup E-Trunk status flaps, affecting E-Trunk switchover. However, packets can be forwarded properly.  3. ICB-PW-based MPLS QoS is not supported. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| Multi-hop tunnel attribute: The end and transit nodes of a multi-hop LDP PW support hybrid load balancing among different types of tunnels in a tunnel policy. GRE tunnels are not supported. If GRE tunnels are used, traffic will be interrupted. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| The basic functions of dual-ICB PWs have the following limitations:  1. The control words of ICB-PWs, working PWs, and protection PWs must be the same.  2. The ICB-PW public network does not support ECMP.  3. Secondary faults are not supported.  4. QinQ interfaces on the AC side are not supported.  If the preceding limitations are not met, traffic cannot be forwarded. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| The basic dual-ICB PW functions have the following restrictions:  1. In E-APS 1+1 scenarios, only dual ICB PWs are supported.  2. In APS 1+1 scenarios, TE fast protection switching is not supported.  3. In an AC fault or fault recovery scenario, because APS is inter-chassis, two master or backup APS devices may exist for a short period of time. As a result, excess packets are generated or packet loss occurs for a short period of time.  If the preceding restrictions are not met, traffic is interrupted. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H |
| Different DiffServ modes can be configured in the inbound and outbound directions of a PE. The hard pipe configuration is mutually exclusive with the DiffServ mode configuration for a static VLL.  Do not configure the DiffServ mode in hard pipe scenarios. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H |
| When a VPWS recurses to an SRv6 TE Policy, the last SID cannot be of the END.X type. Otherwise, traffic fails to be forwarded.  Plan services properly. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| In an MS-PW scenario where primary and secondary PWs are connected to dual-homing RSGs, the settings of parameters (such as the MTU, control word, and TDM interface parameters) on the RSG interfaces with PWs configured must be consistent. If the parameters are configured differently, some services may go down. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| After the device is restarted, as long as the BFD session status is not Up, the primary and secondary PWs are associated for service switching. The PW whose BFD detection status is Up is preferentially served. However, if the primary and secondary PWs are not Up, PW switching is not affected. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| In IP hard pipe scenarios:  1. If the hard pipe function is enabled in the VSI-LDP view, only static PWs can be configured. In this case, a tunnel binding policy must be configured and the tunnel type must be static bidirectional LSP. Otherwise, services are abnormal.  2. If a peer has been configured in the VSI-LDP view, hard pipe cannot be configured.  3. If QoS has been configured for a PW, hard pipe cannot be configured for the PW.  4. Only LDP VSIs are supported. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| In an MS-PW scenario where a CSG is dual-homed to ASGs and primary and secondary PWs are configured on the ASGs, VLL redundancy protection must work in master/slave mode. The ASGs cannot determine the active/standby status of PWs. If PW redundancy in independent mode is used, delayed switching does not work. In this case, service interruption lasts for a long time during protection switching. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
