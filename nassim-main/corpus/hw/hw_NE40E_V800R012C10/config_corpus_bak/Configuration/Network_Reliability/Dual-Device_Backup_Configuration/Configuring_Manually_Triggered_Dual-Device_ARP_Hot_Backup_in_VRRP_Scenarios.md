Configuring Manually Triggered Dual-Device ARP Hot Backup in VRRP Scenarios
===========================================================================

This section describes how to configure manually triggered dual-device ARP hot backup in VRRP scenarios. After the configuration is complete, the ARP entries between two devices in a VRRP group are backed up to ensure link connectivity during an master/backup switchover.

#### Context

Before configuring manually triggered dual-device ARP hot backup in VRRP scenarios, configure link layer protocol parameters for interfaces and ensure that the link layer protocol on each interface is up.
