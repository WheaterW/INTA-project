| Feature Requirements | Series | Models |
| --- | --- | --- |
| When a Y.1731 ETH-BN instance is used to monitor an Eth-Trunk interface, Y.1731 detection based on Eth-Trunk member interfaces cannot be configured on the peer device. Otherwise, the local device incorrectly receives the bandwidth of the Eth-Trunk member interfaces and performs associated optimization. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| The receiving mode of Y.1731 synthetic frame loss measurement is changed. When the software-based packet receiving mode is switched to the hardware-based packet sending mode, packet loss occurs. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| When the receive end of Y.1731 SLM switches the packet sending and receiving mode to hardware-based packet sending and receiving, board resources cannot be selected, and packet loss occurs. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| Association between 802.1ag and UNI interface: The association modes configured on the local and peer ends must be the same. Otherwise, the association may be abnormal. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| In scenarios where the port default vlan command is run on a GE Layer 2 interface to configure the interface as a default or untagged EVC sub-interface, after the Layer 2 GE interface is bound to a port MEP, the port MEP status is incorrectly detected as down.  You are advised to plan MEPs properly. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| When an MEP is bound to a QinQ interface, only the following QinQ protocol types are supported: 0x8100, 0x9100, 0x88a8, and 0x9200. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| When a MEP is bound to a VLL or VSI interface, CCM packets do not carry VLAN information, and priority-based statistics collection is not supported. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| When a MEP is bound to a VLL or VSI interface, Y.1731 packets do not carry VLAN information and priority-based statistics are not supported. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| An outward-facing MEP (on a VLL/VSI main interface) and a port MEP (on any member interface) cannot be configured at the same time on a trunk interface. Otherwise, 802.1ag goes down.  You are advised to plan MAs and MEPs properly. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| In scenarios where the port default vlan command is run on a trunk main interface, after the trunk member interfaces are bound to port MEPs, the port MEP status is incorrectly detected as down.  You are advised to plan MEPs properly. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| Y.1731 single-ended and dual-ended frame loss measurement on the PW side does not support public network load balancing or public network Eth-Trunk. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| Y.1731 single-ended frame loss measurement and dual-ended frame loss measurement cannot be configured at the same time. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| Y.1731 single-ended frame delay measurement must be used together with 1588v2 clock synchronization. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| Y.1731 one-way/two-way frame delay measurement on the PW side does not support public network load balancing. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| Priority-based Y.1731 proactive measurement and non-priority-based Y.1731 proactive measurement cannot be configured at the same time. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| Association between 802.1ag and interface is not supported in local CCC scenarios where inward-facing MEPs are configured. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| For a Layer 2 interface whose port link type is access or hybrid, if the VLAN associated with the MEP is the default VLAN, DM/SLM packets do not carry VLAN tags and DM/SLM measurement with priorities is not supported. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| If CFM is configured on a Layer 3 physical interface, when the interface is added to or removed from an Eth-Trunk interface, CFM is interrupted and then automatically recovers. A false EOAM alarm is generated or EOAM association is incorrectly configured.  You are advised not to add a Layer 3 physical interface bound to a MEP to or remove the interface from a trunk interface when a detection is being performed. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| A port MEP and an outward-facing MEP on a VLL/VSI main interface cannot be configured on the same physical interface. Otherwise, 802.1ag goes down.  You are advised to plan MAs and MEPs properly. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| An ETH-test receiving instance can collect statistics on protocol traffic with a maximum of five different source MAC addresses. When more than five source MAC addresses are received, statistics are not collected. A maximum of five ETH-test sending instances can have their data sent to the same ETH-test receiving instance. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| In VPLS and VLAN scenarios, if the system MAC address mode is used, the Y.1731 statistics function cannot be used normally. You need to switch the system MAC address mode to the interface MAC address mode. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| When Y.1731 packet loss measurement is enabled and load balancing paths exist on the public network, Y.1731 packets and data packets are transmitted over different paths. As a result, Y.1731 packets and data packets are out of order, causing inaccurate packet loss statistics.  Plan services properly. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| Y.1731 packet loss measurement cannot be deployed in dual-homing access scenarios. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| Unidirectional transmission of fault messages from a BFD session to CFM is configured. In a device restart scenario, when the BFD session status changes to AdminDown, the neighbor status changes to AdminDown, or BFD negotiation times out, CFM notifies the peer end of the fault 3s later, and the peer CFM status is set to Down. When the BFD session goes Down, CFM immediately notifies the peer of the fault and sets the peer CFM status to Down. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| Y.1731 does not support packet loss detection in scenarios where a trunk interface has more than one member interface. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| In EVPN-MPLS scenarios, Y.1731 does not allow single-ended or dual-ended frame loss measurement for inward-facing MEPs. If Y.1731 single-ended or dual-ended frame loss measurement is used, the statistics are inaccurate.  In EVPN-MPLS scenarios, you are advised to use Y.1731 single-ended SLM for inward-facing MEPs. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
| If unidirectional transmission of fault information from a BFD session to EFM is configured and the device is restarted, EFM does not take any action when the BFD session status becomes AdminDown, the neighbor status becomes AdminDown, or BFD negotiation times out. When the BFD session status becomes Down, EFM immediately notifies the peer of the fault. | NE40E-M2 | NE40E-M2E/NE40E-M2F/NE40E-M2H/NE40E-M2K/NE40E-M2K-B |
